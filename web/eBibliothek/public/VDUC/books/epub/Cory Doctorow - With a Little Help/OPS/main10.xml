Visit the Sins</h2>
<div class="text">
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1629">Sean had a way of getting his way — a
way of delivering argument that implied that everyone in earshot
was savvy and bold, and that the diatribe-du-jour was directed at
the Enemies of Art ranged without. His thesis advisor bought it
every time. Sean turned in his due-diligence, a bunch of theses
written in the last century: collected memoirs of the survivors of
electroshock, lobotomies, thalidomide. His advisor signed off and
within twenty-four hours, he was debarking in Orlando and renting a
car to take him to the Home.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1630">He didn't tell his father. He'd have to,
eventually, before he could finish the thesis. But for now, it was
just him and Grampa, head-to-head.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1631">Grampa was switched off when Sean found
him on the ward, which throbbed with a coleslaw of laser-light and
videogames and fuck-pix and explosions and car-wrecks and fractals
and atrocities.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1632">Sean remembered visits before the old
man was committed, he and his dutiful father visiting the
impeccable apartment in the slate house in Kingston, Ontario.
Grampa made tea and conversation, both perfectly executed and
without soul. It drove Sean's father bugfuck, and he'd inevitably
have a displaced tantrum at Sean in the car on the way home. The
first time Grampa had switched on in Sean's presence — it was when
Sean was trying out a prototype of Enemies of Art against his
father's own As All Right-Thinking People Know — it had scared Sean
stupid.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1633">Grampa had been in maintenance mode,
running through a series of isometric stretching exercises in one
corner while Sean and his father had it out. Then, suddenly, Grampa
was between them, arguing both sides with machinegun passion and
lucidity, running an intellect so furious it appeared to be
steam-driven. Sean's tongue died in his mouth. He was made wordless
by this vibrant, violent intellect that hid inside Grampa. Grampa
and his father had traded extemporaneous barbs until Grampa
abruptly switched back off during one of Sean's father's rebuttals,
conceding the point in an unconvincing, mechanical tone. Sean's
father stalked out of the house and roared out of the driveway
then, moving with such speed that if Sean hadn't been right on his
heels, he wouldn't have been able to get in the car before his
father took off.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1634">And now, here was Grampa in maintenance
mode. He was sitting at a table, flexing his muscles one-at-a-time
from top to bottom. It was an anti-pressure-sore routine. Sean
guessed that it was after-market, something the Home made available
for low functioning patients like Grampa.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1635">Sean sat down opposite him. Grampa
smiled and nodded politely. Sean swallowed his gorge. The ones who
had not had the surgery had been scattered, unable to focus. Then
they had the operation, and suddenly it wasn't a problem anymore.
Whenever their attention dropped below a certain threshold, they
just switched off, until the world regained some excitement. It had
been a miracle, until the kids stopped making the effort to keep
their attention above the threshold, and started to slip away into
oblivion.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1636">"Hello, Grampa," Sean said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1637">Grampa stared at him from dark eyes set
in deep, wrinkled nests. Behind them, Sean could almost see the
subroutines churning. "Sean," Grampa said. Woodenly, he stood and
came around the table, and gave Sean a precise hug and cheek-kiss.
Sean didn't bother returning either.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1638">He put the recorder on the table between
them and switched it on.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1639">Grampa was a moderately wealthy man.
He'd achieved much of that wealth prior to his retirement, working
as a machinist on really delicate, tricky stuff. The family assumed
that he did this work switched off, letting the subroutines run the
stultifying repetitions, but in his prelim research, Sean had
talked to one of Grampa's co-workers, who said that Grampa had
stayed switched on more often than not. Grampa had acquired the
rest of the wealth shortly before Sean's father had sent him south,
to the Home. The years-old class action suit brought by the guilty,
horrified families of accidental zombies had finally ended with a
settlement, and all the Survivors became instant millionaires in
trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1640">For all the good it did them.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1641">"How are you?" Grampa asked,
placidly.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1642">"I'm working on my thesis, Grampa. I'm
here to interview you — I'll be around for the next couple
weeks."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1643">"That's nice," Grampa said. "How's your
father?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1644">"He's fine. I didn't tell him I was
coming down, though. You're a touchy subject for him."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1645">Grampa settled back into his chair. Sean
was distantly aware of other Survivors on the ward, gabbling and
twitching at videogames and smoking all at once. They were
high-functioning — they could be switched on with simple stim;
Grampa only switched on for important occasions.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1646">Sean said, "Dad wishes you'd die."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1647">That did it. It was easy to tell when
Grampa was switched on; the rhythmic, methodical maintenance
twitching was replaced with a restless, all-over fidget; and his
eyes darted around the room. "Is he in some kind of financial
trouble? He doesn't need to wait for a bequest — I'll write to the
trustees right now."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1648">Sean restrained himself from saying
hello again, now that Grampa was switched on. He kept himself
focused on the task of keeping Grampa switched on. "He wishes you'd
die because he hates you and he hates himself for it. When you die,
he can stop hating you and start mourning you. He knows it wasn't
your fault. That's why I'm here. I want to collect your stories and
make some sense out of them, before you die." Sean took a deep
breath. "Will you stay switched on?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1649">Grampa looked uncomfortable. "Your
grandmother used to ask me that. I'd promise her I'd do it, every
time, but then… It's not voluntary, Sean. It's reflex."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1650">"It's a learned reflex, Grampa. It's not
breathing. You didn't ask to have the surgery, but you learned the
reflex all on your own. You <i>allow</i> your attention to drop
below the threshold, you <i>allow</i> the chip to switch you off.
Some people do it less," he jerked his head at the other old men
and women, playing their twitch games and shouting argument at each
other. "Some don't do it at all."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1651">"Bullshit!" Grampa said, leaning forward
and planting his hands on his knees — aggro Type-A body-language
that Sean often found himself assuming. "Urban legend, kid.
Everyone learned it. Once you had the surgery, you couldn't help
it. You know what I'm talking about, or you wouldn't be here. Your
father, too — if he was ever honest enough to admit it. You've both
got it as bad as me, but no one ever tried to <i>cure</i> you."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1652">"I don't have it," Sean said. "I just
got off a three-hour plane-ride, and I was able to just look out
the window the whole way. It didn't bother me. That's not coping
mechanism, either — I never even <i>wanted</i> to watch the
seat-back vid or chat up my neighbor." It wasn't true, actually. He
had fidgeted like crazy, splitting the screen-in-screen on the
seat-back into sixteen quads and watching as many stations as he
could. He'd tried to assemble his thoughts on his recorder, but
he'd been too wound up. Eventually, somewhere over Georgia, he'd
surrendered to the screen and to counting powers of two.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1653">Grampa pierced him with his stare. "If
your ego demands that you believe that, then go ahead."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1654">Sean restrained himself from squirming.
He focused himself on directing the discussion. "What do you like
best about the Home?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1655">Grampa considered the question for so
long that Sean was afraid he'd switched off. "No one makes me feel
guilty for switching off. No one tells me that I'm weak. Except
your father, of course."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1656">"Dad's been here?" Sean said, shocked.
"When?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1657">"Your father visits every month. He
shouts at me until I switch on, then he leaves. He does it because
the doctor told him that if I didn't switch on more often that
they'd move me to the zero-function ward. Sounds fine to me, and I
tell him so, but he's never thought much of his brain-damaged old
man."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1658">"Where do you go when you're switched
off?" Sean asked. It was a question that was supposed to come later
in the interview, maybe on day two, but he was rattled.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1659">"I don't know. Away."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1660">"Is it like sleep?" Sean said,
forgetting the rule that you never ask the subject a simple yes/no
question. His heart thudded in his chest, like he was giving the
first interview of his life.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1661">"No."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1662">"How is it different from sleep?" Sean
asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1663">"I usually switch on for sleep — my
subconscious is pretty good at entertaining me, actually. When I
switch off, I just… go away. I remember it later, like it was a
book that got read directly into my brain, but I'm <i>not
there</i>. It's fucking great. You'd love it, Sean. You should get
the surgery. I hear that there's a lot of black-market clinics
where you can get it done: South-East Asia. The sex-trade, you
know."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1664">Sean struggled to keep the discussion
on-track. Grampa was often hostile when he was switched on, and his
father always rose to the bait. Sean wasn't going to. "How do you
know that you're not there? Maybe you're there the whole time,
bored stupid, screaming in frustration, and you forget it all as
soon as you switch on?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1665">Grampa raised an eyebrow at him. "Of
course I am! But that's not the <i>me</i> that's important —
<i>I'm</i> the one that counts. And I get to fast-forward past all
the slow parts. Which this is turning into, I'm afraid."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1666">Grampa's eye's stopped seeking out the
ward's corners, and he slipped back into maintenance mode. The
noise and lights of the ward closed in around Sean. He scooped up
his recorder. "Thanks, Grampa," he said, woodenly. "I'll see you
tomorrow."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1667">"Bye, Sean," Grampa said, and came
around the table for another hug and kiss.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1668">Sean checked into the first motel he
found, the Lamplighter Inn, on a dreary strip populated with
disused water-parks and crumbling plazas. He lay down on the bed,
fed the Magic Fingers, and played back the recording.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1669">It was junk. The noise of the ward
masked nine words in ten, and what words made it through were
empty, devoid of any kind of emotional freight. He tried to
transcribe it longhand, filling in the blanks from memory, but
couldn't keep his mind on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1670">He took off his sweaty, wrinkled T-shirt
and slacks, dumped out his suitcase on the chipped,
cigarette-burned table, and found his bathing suit.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1671">There was one other guest by the pool,
an old, old woman in a one-piece with a skirt, wearing a sunhat
tilted to shade her from the last of the pounding Florida sun. Sean
gave her a perfunctory nod and jumped in.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1672">The water was piss-warm, thickly
chlorinated. It felt like swimming in pungent sweat. Sean managed
one lap and then crawled out and sat in a sway-backed
deck-chair.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1673">"I wouldn't go swimming in that if I
were you," the old woman said, in a husky, nicotine-stained voice.
She clattered a grin at him through her dentures. She was the color
and texture of rawhide, not so much tanned as <i>baked</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1674">"Now you tell me," Sean said, squinting
at her under his hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1675">"Old Ross doesn't like dealing with the
pool, so he just keeps on shoveling in the chlorine. Don't be
surprised if you're blonde in the morning. My name's Adele. You
here for long?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1676">"A couple weeks, at least," Sean
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1677">Adele smiled and nodded. "That's good.
That's fine. A good stretch of time to see the Parks. Don't miss
Universal, either — I think it's better than Disney. Most people
don't bother with it, but for my money, it's better."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1678">"I don't think I'll get a chance to
visit either," Sean said. "I've got a lot of work to do down here."
He waited for her to ask him what kind of work, and mentally
rehearsed the high-concept speech that he'd given a thousand times
while working on the thesis proposal.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1679">"What a shame," she said. "Where did you
come down from?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1680">"Toronto," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1681">"Lord, not another snowbird!" she said,
good-naturedly. "Seems like half of Canada's down here! They come
here to get away from the winter, then they complain about the
heat! What do they expect, that's what I want to know! Was your
flight good?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1682">"It was fine," Sean said, bemusedly. "A
little dull, but fine."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1683">"So, you're here for a few weeks," Adele
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1684">"Yes. Working," Sean said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1685">"Nice work if you can get it!" Adele
said, and clattered her dentures again. "I moved here, oh, five
years ago. To be near my boy. In the hospital. I used to work, but
I'm retired. Used to work at a dairy — answering the phones! You
tell people you used to work in a dairy, they think you were
milking the cows! Old Ross, he gives me an annual rate for my room.
It's better than living in one of those gated places! Lord! How
much shuffleboard can a body stand?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1686">"Your son is sick?" Sean said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1687">"Not sick, no," Adele said. "You
wouldn't believe the roaches you get down here! Old Ross fumigates
regular, but Florida roaches don't seem to care. I've lived in New
York, and I've seen some pretty big roaches in my day, but not like
these. Like cats! My boy, Ethan, he'd clean and clean our apartment
in New York, quiet as you please, a good boy. Then he'd see a roach
and whim-wham, he'd be talking, joking, skipping and running. Old
Ross says there's nothing he can do — he says, 'Adele, this is
<i>Florida</i>, and the roaches were here long before us, and
they'll be here long after, and nothing we do is going to keep them
away.' That's all fine and good, but let me tell you, I've never
seen a roach in the Home when I was visiting Ethan. <i>They</i>
know how to keep them out. Maybe it's all the shouting. Lord, but
they do shout!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1688">A small lightbulb blinked in Sean's
mind. "Is Ethan very high-functioning?" he asked, carefully.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1689">Adele glanced sidelong at him and said,
"The doctor says no. But I think he is. He's always walking around
when I'm there, doing push-ups and sit-ups. He's not a young man,
Ethan — sixty this year! When his father was that age, he didn't do
any push-ups, no sir! But the doctor, he says that Ethan's at zero
function. Doctors! What do they know?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1690">"How old was Ethan when he had the
surgery?" Sean asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1691">"Just seven," Adele said, without
changing her light tone, but Sean saw knives of guilt in her eyes.
"He was going to be held back in the first grade, or sent to a
special school. They sent a doctor around to explain it. Ethan was
smart as a whip, everyone knew that, but he just couldn't
<i>concentrate</i>. It made him miserable, and he'd pitch these
hissyfits all the time. It didn't matter where he was: the
classroom, home, out on the street — in church! He'd scream and
shout and kick and bite, you've never seen anything like it. The
doctors, they told us that he'd just keep on getting worse unless
we did something about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1692">"It seemed like a miracle. In my day,
they'd just drug you up."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1693">Sean knew the names of the old drugs:
Ritalin, Cylert, Dexedrine. Anything that would keep you still and
numb. Then came the surgery.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1694">Adele brightened. "You should really try
to at least visit Universal for an afternoon, you know. It's
lovely."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1695">"They're going to move my grandfather to
the zero-function ward, I think. If he doesn't spend more time
switched on, they will." Sean said. "I want to get his story before
they do it." And if not his stories, the <i>reasons</i> — reasons
for who Sean was, who his father was.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1696">"What a nice grandson you are! You know,
it seems like no one cares about their grandparents anymore. Old
Ross's grandchildren haven't visited once in the five years I've
been here."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1697">Sean gave Adele a ride the next day. She
wore the sunhat and a lightweight cotton dress and sandals, and
looked frail and quaint.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1698">Sean thought Adele would get off at a
different floor, to visit Ethan, but she walked with him across
Grampa's ward.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1699">Grampa was sitting just where he had
been the day before. His chin was shaved blue, and he was
impeccable. He was methodically slicing and eating a hamburger.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1700">"Grampa," Sean said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1701">"Hello, Sean," Grampa said. He laid his
knife and fork in a precise X on his plate and pushed it aside.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1702">"This is Adele. Her son is in the
zero-function ward. She wanted to meet you. Adele, this is my
grandfather, Brice Devick."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1703">"Pleased to meet you, Adele," Grampa
said, and shook her hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1704">"Likewise," she said. "Do you know my
Ethan? I'm worried that he doesn't seem to have any friends
here."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1705">"I haven't met him," Grampa said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1706">"Well, would you do an old lady a big
favor? Go and visit him. Your grandson tells me you're smart —
Ethan is as smart as a whip. You two should have lots to talk
about."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1707">"I will," Grampa said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1708">"I'm sure you two will get on very well.
It was a pleasure to meet you. Excuse me, I'm sure Ethan's
wondering where I am."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1709">Sean waited until she was out of
earshot, then said, "Her son's a fucking vegetable. You're about
eighty percent of the way there. You're spending so much time
switched off, you might as well be dead."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1710">"What do you know about it?" Grampa
said, fidgeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1711">"I know plenty," Sean said. "Plenty! You
spent less than fifteen percent of the time switched off until you
hit college. Then you switched off for months at a time. You used
it for a study aid! I pulled your logfiles, when I was at Dad's —
he's had them ever since you were declared <i>non compos</i>.
You're a junkie, Grampa. You don't have the willpower to kick your
habit, and it makes my Dad nuts. I never knew you, so it just makes
me curious. Let's talk about the first time you remember switching
off."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1712">Grampa snorted. "That's a <i>stupid</i>
question. You <i>don't</i> remember switching off — that's the
whole point."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1713">Sean rolled his eyes. "You know what I
mean. You may not remember switching off, but you'll remember
switching on. Switching on <i>has</i> to be memorable, doesn't it?
Isn't that the whole point?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1714">"Fine. I switched on for about 20
minutes in a movie that I snuck out of school to see when I was
twelve. It was in French, and it had made a lot of noise because it
had a sex scene with a live pig. I saw that scene, and two others —
another sex scene and a scene where this woman cuts the pig's
throat. I loved it. All my friends had done the same thing, but by
the time the good parts had come around, they were too bored to
enjoy them. I just caught the highlight reel."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1715">"How long until you next switched
off?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1716">"I don't know. A while."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1717">"It was two days. I have the logfile,
remember, Grampa? Don't jerk my chain. You switched off during
Friday dinner. Did your parents notice?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1718">"Of course they noticed! They loved it!
For once, I wasn't kicking the table-leg or arguing with my sisters
or stuffing sprouts in my pocket. I cleaned my plate, then sat and
waited until everyone else was done, then I did the dishes."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1719">"How'd you like it?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1720">"I loved it! I hated family dinners! I
just got the highlight reel again — dessert! I remember that
fucking bowl of pudding like I was eating it right now. My mother
couldn't cook for shit, but she sure opened a mean package of Jello
Pudding."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1721">Sean found his mood matching Grampa's,
aggressive and edgy. "How did you and Grandma end up getting
married? I can't imagine that she was hot for a zombie like
you."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1722">"Oh, but she <i>was</i>, Sean, she
<i>was</i>!" Grampa waggled his eyebrows lasciviously. "Your
Grandma didn't like people much. She knew she had to get married,
her folks expected no less, but she mostly wanted to be off on her
own, doing her own thing. I'd come home, switch off, clean the
place, do any chores she had for me, then go to bed. She loved to
have sex with me switched off — it got so that if I accidentally
switched on while we were doing it, I'd pretend I was still off,
until she was done. It was the perfect arrangement."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1723">"But she divorced your sorry ass after
ten years," Sean said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1724">"You got a girlfriend, Sean?" Grampa
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1725">"No," Sean said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1726">"You <i>ever</i> had a girlfriend?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1727">"Yes," Sean said, feeling slightly smug.
Never ask yes/no question.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1728">"Why'd she leave you?" Grampa asked, his
eyes sharp as razors.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1729">"What makes you think <i>she</i> left
<i>me</i>?" Sean asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1730">"Did she?" Grampa fired back.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1731">"Yes," Sean said, as calmly as he could
manage.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1732">"And why did that happen?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1733">"We were growing in different
directions," Sean said, the words sounding prim even to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1734">Grampa barked and slapped his palm on
the table. The old men and women in the ward swiveled their heads
to stare, momentarily distracted, then went back to arguing.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1735">"You're full of shit, kid. What's that
supposed to mean?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1736">"I was working on my thesis proposal.
Lara was working on hers. Neither of us had time for a
relationship. It was amicable."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1737">Lara had caught him watching television
over her shoulder while she was delivering one of her dreaded
Relationship Briefings, and had laid into him a little too hard.
He'd come back at her with everything he had, an extended rant that
ranged from her lame-ass thesis — the cultural impact of some
obscure TV show from before they'd been born — to her backbiting,
over educated circle of friends. He'd moved onto her relationship
with her mother; her insufferable whining about a suicidal uncle
she'd been close to; and her pretentious way of sprinkling her
speech with stupid pseudo-intellectual buzzwords. He crossed the
line again and again and she kicked him out on his ass.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1738">"Dad says that you never switched on
during the divorce."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1739">"Your Dad has nothing to complain about.
He got enough pity lavished on him to kill ten men. It was all your
grandmother's family could do not to devour him whole."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1740">"But you stayed switched off," Sean
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1741">"In the court, I was switched off. Ever
been in a court, Sean?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1742">"You stayed switched off."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1743">"In the court-room."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1744">"And before, during the separation?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1745">"Same thing," Grampa said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1746">"And after, during visitations?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1747">"Not then," Grampa said, loudly. "Not
during visitations."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1748">"I've got the logfiles, Grampa," Sean
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1749">"What the hell do a twelve-year-old and
a grown man have to talk about? I kept him fed. I took him out to
the carny and to kiddee movies. I drove him to hockey."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1750">"You <i>switched off</i>, Grampa," Sean
said. "The <i>you that counted</i> wasn't there."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1751">"Sophistry," Grampa said. "Bullshit. I
remember all of it. I was there. Not many other parents were, let
me tell you. Usually, it was just me and a few others in the
stands, or kids running around loose like animals at the carny.
Your father has <i>nothing</i> to complain about."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1752">"Why, aren't you two looking excited?"
Adele said, hobbling alongside of the table. She was leaning on
Ethan, a vigorous old man with sinewy arms and dead eyes. His face
was unlined, free from smile lines and frowning creases.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1753">"Hi, Adele," Sean said, trying to keep
the exasperation out of his voice.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1754">"Ethan, this is Sean and his
grandfather, Brice."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1755">Ethan extended his hand and Sean shook
it. "Very nice to meet you," Ethan said. His hand was dry and
papery, his eyes vacant. Sean shook it, and a frisson of shameful
disgust sizzled up his abdomen. He had a sudden vision of Ethan's
brain, desiccated in his skull, the gleaming edges of the chip
poking free. He surreptitiously wiped his hand on his pants as
Ethan turned to Grampa and shook his hand. "Very nice to meet
you."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1756">"Do you mind if we sit down?" Adele
said. "I'm afraid that I'm a little pooped. All those stairs!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1757">Sean offered his chair and went off to
the lounge with Ethan to get two more. When they got back, Adele
had her hand on Grampa's forearm. " — I worked in a dairy,
answering the phones! You tell people you used to work in a dairy,
they think you were milking the cows!" Adele laughed and Grampa
shot Sean a hostile look.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1758">Sean said, "Grampa was a machinist
before he retired. You really liked doing that, huh, Grampa?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1759">Grampa nodded perfunctorily.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1760">"I mean, the logfiles show that you
almost never switched off at work. Must've been pretty engrossing.
You should give workshops here. I bet it'd be good therapy." Sean
knew he was baiting the old man, but he couldn't stop himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1761">"Your father's arriving tomorrow,"
Grampa said. "He called last night. I didn't tell him you were
here, I thought it would be a nice surprise."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1762">Adele clapped her hands. "Well isn't
that <i>nice</i>! Three generations, all together. Sean, you'll
have to introduce Ethan and I to your father. Ethan never had
children, isn't that right?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1763">Ethan said, "Yes."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1764">"Always the bachelor, my boy. But it
wasn't for lack of opportunity. You had to beat them off with a
stick, didn't you, son?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1765">Ethan said, "Yes."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1766">"I always hoped for a grandchild to
hold, but you have to let your children live their own lives, isn't
that right, Brice?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1767">"Yes," Grampa said, with a kind of
horrified fascination.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1768">"Ethan was always too busy for
romance."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1769">"Yes," Ethan said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1770">"Working and working and working for
that transcription service. You must have typed a million words.
Did you ever count them, Ethan?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1771">"Yes," Ethan said. "I typed roughly
fifteen million words."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1772">"Nowadays, of course, no one types. It's
all talking to computers now. When I was a girl, they all said that
you'd always have a job if you just learned to type. Times sure
change, don't they?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1773">"Yes," Ethan and Grampa said together.
Grampa startled like he'd been shocked.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1774">"Dad's coming tomorrow?" Sean said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1775">Grampa said, "Yes. He's catching the 6
AM. He'll be here by 10."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1776">"Isn't that <i>nice</i>," Adele
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1777">They left Grampa and Ethan sitting at
the table together. Sean looked back over his shoulder before they
got on the elevator, and Grampa was still switched on, staring hard
at him.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1778">"You must be <i>excited</i> about seeing
your father again," Adele said to him when they were sitting around
the pool.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1779">Sean was getting the hang of talking to
Adele. "Ethan and my grandfather seem to be hitting it off."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1780">"Oh, I certainly <i>hope</i> so! Ethan
could use some friends at that place."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1781">Sean pictured the two of them, seated
across from each other at the ward table, running maintenance
routines at each other, saying, "Yes," "Yes." Unbidden, a grin came
to Sean's face.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1782">"Why did you put Ethan in the Home?"
Sean asked, shifting to catch more sun on his face.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1783">"He wanted to go," she said. "The doctor
came by and told him about it and asked him if he wanted to go, and
he said 'Yes.' That was it!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1784">Sean snuck a look at Adele. She was
wincing into the light, following it like a sunflower. "Adele," he
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1785">"Yes, Sean?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1786">"Ethan was in maintenance mode. He was
switched off. He said 'Yes,' because his subroutines didn't want to
be any trouble. You know that, right?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1787">"Oh, that foolishness again! Ethan's a
<i>good boy</i>, is all. He remembers my birthday and Mother's Day,
every year."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1788">"Subroutines, Adele," Sean said,
straining to keep an inexplicable anger out of his voice.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1789">"Humph! Subroutines!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1790">"Adele, he's a robot. He's a walking
coma. He's been switched off for so long, all you're talking to is
a goddamn <i>chip</i>, he's not a goddamn <i>person</i> anymore.
None of them are. My goddamn <i>Grampa</i>'s spent three-quarters
of his goddamn life <i>away</i>. He's either an angry old bastard,
or he's a goddamn <i>zombie</i>. You <i>know that</i>, right?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1791">"Sean, you're very upset," Adele said.
"Why don't you have a nice lie-down, and we'll talk in the morning.
I can't wait to meet your father!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1792">Sean stalked off to his room and tried
to record some field notes while flipping around in the weird, poky
corners of the motel's cable system, Japanese game-shows and Hindu
religious epics. He smoked half a cigarette, drank half a beer,
tried to masturbate, and finally, slept.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1793">Adele rang his room-phone at eight.
"Rise and shine, sunshine!" she said. "Your father will be at the
airport in an hour!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1794">Sean dressed, but didn't bother shaving
or brushing his teeth. He staggered out to his rental and gave
Adele a sheepish grin. Acid churned in his gut.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1795">Adele waited by the passenger door, in a
pair of slacks and a light blouse. She had hung a pair of
sunglasses around her neck on a gold chain, and carried an enormous
sisal handbag. Staggering in the horrible daylight, Sean opened the
passenger door for her, and offered his arm while she got in.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1796">He put the car onto the Bee Line
Expressway and pointed it at the airport.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1797">"Oh, won't this be <i>fun</i>?" Adele
said, as he ground the crap from the corners of his eyes and
steered with his knees. "I'm sure your father is <i>charming</i>.
Maybe the five of us can go to Universal for an afternoon."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1798">"I don't think we can take them off the
ward," Sean grunted, changing lanes for the airport exit.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1799">"You're probably right," Adele said. "I
was just thinking that Universal might be enough to keep them both
switched on."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1800">Sean shot her a look and nearly missed
his exit.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1801">Adele rattled a laugh at him. "Don't
look so surprised. I know which end is up!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1802">Sean pursed his lips and navigated the
ramp-maze that guarded the airport. He pulled up to the loading
zone at Air Canada arrivals and switched off the engine. He looked
past Adele at the tourists jockeying for cabs. "I'm sorry about
yesterday. I guess I'm a little wound up."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1803">"Yesterday?" Adele said. "Oh! By the
pool!" She put a frail hand on his forearm. "Sean, you don't get to
my age by holding grudges. Ethan's father — <i>he</i> held grudges,
and it killed him. Heart attack. He never forgave the doctors. I'm
just happy to have a chauffeur."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1804">Sean swallowed hard. "I'm sure that
somewhere, Ethan knows that you're visiting him, that you love him.
He's in there." He said it with all the sincerity he could
muster.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1805">"Maybe he is, maybe he isn't," Adele
said. "But it makes me feel better. He's what I've got left. If
you'd like, I'll wait with the car so you can go in and look for
your father."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1806">"No," Sean said. "That's all right.
Dad'll come out for a cab. He's not the sort to dawdle."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1807">"I like a decisive man. That's why I
talked to you by the pool — you just jumped in, because you wanted
a swim."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1808">"Adele, that was <i>stupid</i>. It was
like swimming in a urine sample."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1809">"Same difference. I like a man who can
make up his mind. That's what Ethan's father was like:
decisive."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1810">"You'll like my Dad," Sean said. He
drummed his fingers on the wheel, then lowered and raised his
window. He whistled tunelessly through his teeth. Adele gave him a
considering stare and he stopped, and started in on powers of two
in his head.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1811">"There he is," Sean said, 224 later.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1812">Sean had barely been in Florida for
three days, but it was long enough that his father seemed as pale
as freezer-burned ice cream. Sean checked the traffic in his
rear-view, then pulled across the waiting area to where his father
stood, acing out an irate cabbie for the spot.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1813">Sean's father glared at the car and
started to walk behind it to the taxi. Sean leaned on the horn and
his father stooped and stared. His expression was bland and grim
and affectless.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1814">Sean powered down Adele's window.
"Dad!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1815">"Sean?" his father said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1816">Sean popped the locks. "Get in, Dad,
I'll give you a ride."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1817">Adele turned around as Sean's father was
buckling in. "I'm Adele. Sean and I were thinking of taking you to
Universal. Would you like that?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1818">Sean's father stared right through her,
at Sean. "It's an obvious question, I know, but what are you doing
here?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1819">"It's my thesis," Sean said, and floored
the rental, headed for the Home.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1820">"Whee!" Adele said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1821">"*How's Grampa?" Sean's father
asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1822">"Oh, he's delightful," Adele said. "We
introduced him to my Ethan yesterday, and they're getting along
famously. Sean, introduce me to your charming father, please."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1823">"Dad," Sean said, through grit teeth,
"This is Adele. Adele, my father, Mitch. We were thinking of
getting day-passes for Grampa and Ethan and taking them to
Universal. You ever been to Universal, Dad? I hear you come here
down a lot." His normally fragmented attention was as focused as a
laser, boring into his father through the rear-view.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1824">His father's stern face refused to
expose any of his confusion. "I don't think I want to go to
Universal," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1825">"Oh, but it's <i>wonderful</i>," Adele
gushed. "You shouldn't knock it until you've tried it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1826">"I don't think so," Sean's father
repeated. "What's your thesis?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1827">Sean plunged headlong into the breech.
"It's called 'The Tri-Generational Deficit: What's My Father's
Excuse?'"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1828">Sean's father nodded curtly. "And how's
it going?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1829">"Well, you have to understand, I'm just
warming up to the subject with Grampa. And then I'll have to do an
interview series with you, of course."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1830">"Did I miss something? When did I become
the principle ogre in your pantheon? Are you angry at me?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1831">Sean barked a laugh and turned onto the
Home's exit-ramp. "I guess I am, Dad. Grampa had the operation — it
was <i>easy</i> for him to switch off. You needed to make a special
effort." The words flew from his mouth like crows, and Sean clamped
his jaw shut. He tensed for the inevitable scathe of verbiage. None
came. He risked a glance in his rear-view.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1832">His father was staring morosely out at
the Home. Adele patted Sean's hand and gave him a sympathetic look.
Sean parked the car.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1833">"Hi, Pop," Sean's father said, when they
came to the table where Grampa sat. Ethan sat across from him.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1834">Grampa glared at them. "This guy won't
leave me alone. He's a fucking vegetable," he said, gesturing at
Ethan. Adele pursed her lips at him. He patted her arm absently.
"It needed to be said."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1835">Sean's father reached around the table
and gave Grampa a stiff hug. "Good to see you, Pop."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1836">"Yeah, likewise. Sit down, Mitch. Sit
down, Sean. Sit down, Adele." They sat. "Ask your questions, Sean,"
he ordered.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1837">Sean found himself tongue-tied. He
heaved a deep breath and closed his eyes for a moment. He thought
about why he was here: not the reason he'd given his thesis
advisor, but the <i>real</i> goddamn reason. He wanted to
<i>understand</i> — his father, himself. He wanted to
reverse-engineer his father's childhood. He looked at Ethan, slack
as Grampa had been whenever they'd visited. An inkling glimmered.
"Does Ethan scare you, Grampa?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1838">Adele <i>tsk</i>ed and scowled.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1839">"Do I scare you, Mitch?" Grampa said, to
Sean's father.</p>

<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1840">"Yes," Sean's father said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1841">"Yes," Grampa said. "Next question."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1842">"Do you think that switching off is a
sign of weakness?" Sean said, sneaking a glance at his father,
seeing his grandfather's features echoed in his father's face.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1843">"Yes," his father said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1844">"Of course," his grandfather said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1845">"Then why?" Sean said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1846">"You know why," Ethan said, his eyes
glittering.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1847">They all swiveled to look at him.
"Because the alternative is the purest shit," Ethan said, standing
up, starting to pace, almost shouting to make himself heard over
the din of the ward. "Because if you have to ask, you'll never
understand. Because dessert is better than dinner, because the
cherry on top is the best part of the sundae. Because strength is
over-rated."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1848">Grampa applauded briefly, sardonically.
"Because holding your nose and taking your medicine is awful.
Because boredom is a suppurating wound on the mind. Because
self-discipline is over-rated. You getting all this, Sean?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1849">But Sean was watching his father, who
was staring in fascinated horror at Grampa. Nauseous regret
suffused Sean, as he saw his father's composure crumble. How many
times had he tried to shatter that deadly cool? And here he'd done
it. He'd really done it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1850">Still looking at his father, Sean said,
"Do you ever wonder how it feels to rank below oblivion in
someone's book?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1851">Grampa spread hands on the table. "I
can't help it if you take it personally."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1852">Sean's father reeled back, and Sean
swallowed a throb of anger. "Of <i>course</i> not, Grampa. I
understand. It's a reflex. The world's full of sops who'll take
offence at any little thing" — Lara shriveling under the heat of
his tongue, and him still watching the TV over her shoulder — "but
it's a <i>reflex</i>. It's not conscious. It's no one's
<i>fault</i>."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1853">"Don't humor me," Grampa snapped. "I
know what you all think of me. I can feel your goddamn blame. I
can't <i>do</i> anything about it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1854">"You could apologize," Ethan said. Adele
took his hand and wiped at her tears with its back.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1855">"Fuck off, zombie," Grampa said, glaring
at him.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1856">Sean's father stood abruptly. "I'm glad
to see you're in good health, Pop," he said. "Sean, thanks for the
ride. I guess I'll see you once you've finished your research." His
face was hard, composed. "Adele, nice to have met you."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1857">"Likewise," Adele said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1858">"Bye, then," Sean's father said, and
walked with dignified calm to the elevator.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1859">"Bye, Dad," Sean called softly at his
retreating back.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1860">He turned back to Grampa, but Grampa's
eyes were dull, and he was methodically twitching,
top-to-bottom.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1861">"Adele," Sean said, taking her free
hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1862">"Yes?" she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1863">"How would you and Ethan like to come to
Universal with me for the afternoon?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1864">"I'd love to," Ethan said. Sean looked
at Ethan, and couldn't decide if he was switched off or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1865">Whichever, Adele didn't seem to
mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">

<p class="norm" id="o1866"><b>Afterword:</b></p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1867">I probably have some mild ADD, but I
think I've turned it into a pro-survival adaptation for a life
composed of lots of short, intense bursts of stimulus and work. But
I'm also familiar with the powerful urge to switch off and make the
boring stuff <i>go away</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1868">My grandfather, Avram Doctorow, died of
complications from senile dementia in a seniors' psych ward at a
Jewish hospital in Toronto. It was a good place, but it wasn't a
happy place, and his last few years were very hard. Most of the
time, he just wasn't <i>there</i>, but every now and again, he'd
realize where he was, what had happened to him, and he'd cry
uncontrollably. Those times are the most haunting things I've ever
seen.</p>
