The Right Book</h2>
<div class="text">
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o433">Now (-ish)</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o434">The thing that Arthur liked best about
owning his own shop was that he could stock whatever he pleased,
and if you didn't like it, you could just shop somewhere else. So
there in the window were four ancient Cluedo sets rescued from a
car-boot sale in Sussex; a pair of trousers sewn from a salvaged
WWII bivouac tent; a small card advertising the availability of
artisanal truffles hand-made by an autistically gifted chocolatier
in Islington; a brick of Pu'er tea that had been made in Guyana by
a Chinese family who'd emigrated a full century previous; and, just
as of now, six small, handsomely made books.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o435">The books were a first for Arthur. He'd
always loved reading the things, but he'd worked at bookshops
before opening his own little place in Bow, and he knew the
book-trade well enough to stay well away. They were bulky, these
books, and low-margin (Low margin? Two-for-three titles actually
<i>lost</i> money!), and honestly, practically no one read books
anymore and what they did read was mostly rubbish. Selling books
depressed Arthur.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o436">These little buggers were different,
though. He reached into the window — the shop was so small he could
reach it without leaving his stool behind the till — and plucked
one out and handed it to the kid who'd just asked for it. She was
about 15, with awkward hair and skin and posture and so on, but the
gleam in her eye that said, "Where have you been all my life?" as
he handed her the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o437">"They're all carrying them in school,"
she said. "Never thought I'd find one in a shop, though. How
much?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o438">Arthur compared the book to his
cheat-sheet behind the counter. This one had a cover made from old
Hacks tins, resurfaced with a spectral spiderweb of rotting Irish
lace. The chapters within had a whopping aggregate score of 98
percent, meaning that 98 percent of the writing community had rated
them aces or above. Even before he looked to the price column on
his sheet, he knew he was going to have to disappoint her.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o439">"That one's seventy quid, love," he said.
He armored himself for the inevitable shock, disbelief and
protestation, but she just hung her head, resigned.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o440">"Figures," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o441">He ran his fingers down the spines until
he found a cheaper one — bound with floppy felt screened with a
remixed Victorian woodcut of a woman with tentacles for arms. "This
one's got mostly the same text, but I can let you have it for,
erm," he looked at the sheet again, thinking about the wholesale
price, about his margin. "Call it twenty-five pounds."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o442">She shook her head again, gave him a wry
smile. "Still too much. I should have known. It's mostly the posh
kids who've got 'em, the kind who turn up at school with a tenner
just for lunch money."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o443">"You could just read it online, you
know."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o444">"Oh, I do," she said. "Been following it
since it started." Her eyes flicked down. "Wrote a little, too —
didn't make it into the top 100, though."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o445">The Story So Far was part game, part
competition, part creative writing exercise, a massive shared
universe drama with dozens of sub-plots, mysteries, betrayals,
crosses, and double-crosses. Everyone kept saying it was only a
matter of time until the big publishers started to cherry-pick the
best writers from the message-boards, but in the meantime, there
were these little hand-made editions, each one paying a small,
honor-system royalty to the authors they anthologized.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o446">"Have you tried asking your teachers for
help?" He knew as soon as he asked it that it was the wrong sort of
question. She rolled her eyes with adolescent eloquence, then
looked down again. "Only you might be able to get credit for it —
independent study type of thing?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o447">She rolled her eyes again.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o448">"Right," he said. "Right. Well, sorry I
couldn't be more help." The little bell over the door jingled
merrily as she left.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o449">"Back again?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o450">She had her school bag in her hands, zip
opened, bag gaping. He was reminded of all those terrible little
signs that said "No more than two school kids in the shop at any
one time." Fancy that — imagine if it said "No more than two women
in the shop" or "No more than two Asians in the shop" — kids were
the last group you could treat like second class citizens without
being called a bigot.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o451">"Where do you get your copies of The
Book?" she said. The Book, with the capital letters — the one book
with a thousand covers, a million tables of contents, each one not
so much published as made, as curated.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o452">"There's a man," he said. "Art student at
UCL. He's got a little stall at the weekend in the parking
structure where Borough Market used to be."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o453">"So you just buy them from some bloke?
Does he make them?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o454">"I suppose so — he gives me that
impression, anyway." He liked her shrewd, unembarrassed, direct
questioning. Not a single scruple or a hint that she was
embarrassed to be interrogating him about the intimate details of
his trade.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o455">"Do you have, like, an exclusive
arrangement with him?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o456">"No, no, nothing like that." Her hands
were digging through the bag, looking for something.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o457">"Would you think about carrying
these?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o458">She'd clearly bound them herself. Someone
had taught her to really sew, her Gran, maybe. You could see it in
the neat stitching that ran the binding and the spine, holding
together the nylon and the denim, taken from a pair of jeans, a
backpack. The end-papers were yellowed page three girls from the
Star, strategically cropped just below the nipples. He'd been
reading The Story So Far ever since those first six copies had sold
out in forty eight hours, and he had an eye for the table of
contents now, and he flipped to each volume's list, giving them a
long look.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o459">"Who's Chloe Autumn?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o460">She didn't look down, looked at him with
a look that was totally unapologetic. "I am," she said. "It's one
way to get my stuff into print, innit?" She grinned. It was a very
grown up grin.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o461">"What do you think you want for
them?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o462">"Those four I figure you can have cheaply
— say fifteen pounds each. You can sell them for thirty, then.
That's fair, I think."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o463">It was more than fair. His UCL student
wasn't carrying anything for less than forty now, and was only
offering him a 40 percent discount.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o464">"What about returns?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o465">"What's a return?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o466">He reached under the counter and brought
out the shooting stick he used as a spare stool. "Have a seat," he
said. "Let me explain some things. Want a cup of tea? It's Pu'er.
Chinese. Mostly."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o467">+75 years (or so)</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o468">The kids in the shop were like kids
everywhere. That weird, hyperaware thing that came from the games
they played all the time, even in their sleep; the flawless skin
and teeth (because no parent would dare choose otherwise at
conception), the loud, hooting calls that rippled through the
little social groups whenever a particularly bon mot vibrated its
way through their tight little networks, radiating at the speed of
light.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o469">Chloe watched them keenly from her perch
behind the counter. After seventy-some years perching on a stool,
she'd finally done away with it. The exoskeleton she'd been fitted
for on her 90th birthday would lock very handily into a seated
position that took all the pressure off her bum and knees and hips.
It was all rather glorious.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o470">Kids came into the store every day now,
and in ever-increasing numbers. She flicked her eyes sideways and
menued over to her graph of young people in the shop over time,
warming herself on the upward trend.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o471">It was Arthur's 110th birthday today, the
mad old sod, and he was meant to be coming into the shop for one of
his rare tours of inspection. That had the staff all a-twitter. He
was something of a legend, the man who'd started the
distributorship that put small, carefully curated handsful of books
into the few retailers across the land who'd let young people in.
No one could have predicted how well books and Halal fried chicken
went together.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o472">"How long have you known him, then?"
Marcel, her store manager, was only a few years older than the kids
who ghosted past her counter, playing some weird round of their
game, listening to cues only they could hear, heads all cocked
identically.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o473">"Let me put it this way — the first time
we met, I was riding a brontosaurus."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o474">He did her the favor of a smile, radiant
and handsome as a movie marquee. They were all like that these
days. Thankfully she was old enough not to feel self-conscious
about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o475">"Seriously, Chloe, when did you meet
him?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o476">"I was fourteen — no fifteen. That was
before he was Sir Arthur Levitt, Savior of English Literacy, you
understand."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o477">"And before you were Chloe Autumn,
superstar author?" He was kidding her. They'd stopped caring about
what she wrote decades before he was born, but he knew about her
history and liked to tease. He had an easy way about him, and it
showed in the staff.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o478">"Before then, yes."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o479">"I still don't quite understand what it
was he did — what was so different about his bookshop?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o480">"It wasn't a bookshop," she said. "You
didn't know that part?" He shook his head. "Well, that's the most
important part. It wasn't a bookshop. Back then, bookshops were
practically the only place you could get a book. Oh, sure, the
newsagents might carry a few titles, but they were the same titles,
all around the country. Bookshops are fine if you already love
books, but how do you fall in love with books? Where does it start?
There have to be books everywhere, in places where you go before
you know you're a reader. That was the secret."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o481">"So how'd he do it?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o482">"I'll tell you how," Arthur said. He'd
padded up to the counter on the oiled, carefully balanced carapace
of his exoskeleton, moving as spryly as a jaguar. His eyes
glittered with mad, birdy glee. "Hello, Chloe," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o483">"Happy birthday, love," she said,
uncurling herself and levering herself up on tiptoe — the gyros
whining — to give him a kiss on the cheek. "Arthur, this is
Marcel."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o484">They shook hands.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o485">"I'll tell you how," Arthur said again,
clearly enjoying the chance to unfurl one of his old, well-oiled
stories. "It was all about connecting kids up with their local
neighborhoods and the tastes there. Kids know what their friends
want to read. We had them curate their own anthologies of the best,
most suitable material from The Story So Far, put all that local
knowledge to work. The right book for the right person in the right
place. You've got to give them a religious experience before you
can lure them into coming to church regular."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o486">"Arthur thinks reading is a religion,"
Chloe said, noting Marcel's puzzled expression.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o487">"Obsolete, you mean?" Marcel said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o488">Arthur opened his mouth, shut it,
prepared to have an argument. Chloe short-circuited it by reaching
under the counter and producing a carefully wrapped package.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o489">"Happy birthday, you old sod," she said,
and handed it to Arthur.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o490">He was clearly delighted. Slowly, he
picked at the wrapping paper, making something of a production of
it, so much so that the kids started to drift over to watch. He
peeled back a corner, revealing the spine of the book, the neat
stitching, the nylon from an old, old backpack, the worn denim, the
embroidered title on the spine.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o491">"You didn't," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o492">"I certainly did," she said, "now finish
unwrapping it so that we can have some cake."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o493">150 years from now(ish)</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o494">The young man blinked his eyes at the
coruscating lights and struggled into a seated position, brushing
off the powdery residue of his creation. "The Story So Far?" he
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o495">"The Story So Far," a voice agreed with
him from a very long way off and so close in, it was practically up
his nose.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o496">"Better than Great Expectations again,"
he said, getting to his feet, digging through the costumes on the
racks around him. Knowledge slotted itself in his head, asserting
itself. Plots, other characters, what had come before, the
consensus about where things might go next. He didn't like the
consensus. He began to dress himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o497">"Tell me about the reader," he said. The
voice was back in an instant, describing the child (four), the
circumstances of his birth and life, his interests. "So I'm a
picture book?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o498">"No," the voice said. "He's reading in
chapters now. It's the cognitive fashion, here." At <i>here</i>,
more knowledge asserted itself, the shape of the comet on which
they all resided, their hurtling trajectory, a seed-pod of humanity
on its way <i>elsewhere</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o499">"Right," he said, putting on gloves,
picking out a moustache and a sword and a laser-blaster. "Let's go
sell some books."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">—</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o500"><b>Afterword:</b></p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o501">This is another story that was inspired
by Patrick Nielsen Hayden; specifically by his very nice rant about
how the collapse of small, local book distributors that served
grocers and pharmacies — and the rise of national distributors who
serve big-box stores — has destroyed the primary means by which new
readers enter the field. It's all well and good to have terrific
giant bookstores (or fabulous neighborhood stores, for that
matter), but people don't go into those stores unless they already
love books. In the past, the love affair with books often began
outside of bookstores, in grocers and pharmacies, where you might
happen upon any number of quirky, hand-picked paperbacks stocked by
the local distributor. With the choice of books available outside
of bookstores narrowed to the handful of titles with national
distribution, it's far less likely that any given reader will
discover "the right book" — the one that turns her into a
book-junkie for the rest of her life.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o502">Thus, this story. <i>The Bookseller</i>,
Britain's oldest publishing trade magazine, commissioned a story
from me for its 150th anniversary issue — three parts, depicting
the future of bookselling in 50, 100 and 150 years.</p>
