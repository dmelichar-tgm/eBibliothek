I'm Only In It For the Money, by Russell Galen</h2>
<div class="text">
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2966">I'm Cory Doctorow's literary agent. I
advise him on various business and editorial aspects of his writing
career and I negotiate licenses to commercial organizations like
book publishers and movie studios. When I sell a piece of writing
to such an organization, I receive 15% of what the author makes,
and that's how I make a living.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2967">Like any literary agent, I need to keep
my clients happy and loyal, which means selling whatever they need
me to sell. A small press deal could earn me as little as $150 on a
$1,000 advance, but the same client might have a national
bestseller that earns me enough to put a kid through private
college. I handle all these deals, large and small, because it's
what you do when taking care of a writer's entire body of work. But
there's always <i>something</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2968">In the case of this volume, we're not
licensing any rights to any organization, and so there are no fees
or royalties due the author and therefore nothing for me to take
15% of. I'm getting bupkes.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2969">And yet I've happily been one of Cory's
"friends" putting the project together: giving him some advice and
ideas on various aspects of the project; composing a little
contract regarding one aspect of his relationship to lulu.com; and
donating some of my office staff time to maintaining certain
records relating to the venture.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2970">Why would I do such a thing? It's not
<i>pro bono</i>. I'm only in it for the money.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2971">Publishing economics are ridiculous.
Suppose we'd sold this volume to a conventional publisher, and
let's call it a $15.95 trade paperback. The author's share would be
7.5% of the cover price, or $1.17. We're leaving 92.5% — $14.78 —
to bookstores and publishers. There's no room to negotiate a better
share for the author because most of that $14.78 goes to people who
won't reduce their shares: bookstores, paper suppliers, printers,
warehouses, shippers, the owner of the publisher's office building,
taxes, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2972">It's a business model that enables only
a tiny fraction of authors to make even a modest living, while
employees of publishing houses enjoy solid middle class lives with
salaries, health care, pensions, and expense accounts. Most authors
need another job or a supportive spouse to be able to create books.
Or, if they can support themselves from writing, their income is
frighteningly erratic.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2973">Bad as that model is, we'll soon look
back at it as a Golden Age, because the future will be worse. I'm
old enough to remember when the choice was between NBC, CBS, ABC,
whatever was at the local movie theater, or a book. Those days are
long gone, of course, and we ain't seen nothin' yet in terms of the
share of our minds devoted to new media. Book sales have been
trending down for a generation, and haven't bottomed.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2974">As a result, authors' incomes are way
down. Those of us who work on the business side of writing have
always tried to think of new ways for writers to make money, but
now that quest has taken on a new desperation.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2975">New technologies make it theoretically
possible to cut out some of the middlemen, enabling writers to
derive more income from each copy sold, and reach more readers. We
need to find out if this can work.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2976">I've built a career within the
conventional publishing industry. Would I care if that industry
were destroyed by a new model? Editors out of work, bookstores
taken over by rats and squatters? Not really. As long as there's a
way for writers to get their work to readers and be paid a fair
amount for what they provide, I'm content. All of us in the
publishing industry are a mere support structure: we don't have
intrinsic value. We're there to help writers find readers. Anyone
who finds that he's no longer doing that, and has in fact become an
obstacle, needs to get a new job.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2977">It's not just that there might be a way
for writers to earn more from each copy of a book that they sell.
The current model ensures that only certain kinds of books can be
published commercially in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2978">For instance, like most people I have my
own little area of passionate interest. In my case it happens to be
nature, wildlife, and the environment. I like to experience wild
nature and I like to read about it. Sometimes I can help an author
create a commercial book about that subject, but all too often the
material is just too narrow and specialized. Commercial publishers
can't touch such books, and so they either don't get published or
are published by university presses, which often means very
expensive books that are under-marketed and never find their
audience.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2979">When I daydream about a new publishing
model, this is what I secretly dream of. Not my million dollar
clients becoming five million dollar clients: that would be nice
but I don't daydream about it. What I dream of is the book about
slime-mold that can't be created because it would only sell 2,500
copies and earn the author less than $5,000. I dream that using new
technologies and distribution methods, we could find a way to sell
10,000 copies, earning the author $20,000, making the book doable
for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2980">You don't have to share my interest in
slime-mold — which is actually fascinating, but don't get me
started on that — to see that there are millions of worthy books
that will never find a mass audience and never interest the
stressed-out commercial publishers of today.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2981">That's what we're trying to do.
Experiment with a new publishing model that might show a way that
we could reach more people, and keep more of the selling price for
the author, than the old way.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2982">Where do I fit in? I can imagine a world
where there's no bookstore and no publisher, but I can't imagine a
world in which authors — or any other kind of freelance artist —
operate alone, without a business partner, advisor, editorial
consultant, and manager. I know Cory needs me. I just can't figure
out how he's going to pay me. I'm in this project to explore that
question.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2983">For Cory to pay me, he first must make
money for himself. Literary agents can and should only be paid on a
commission basis: that is, as a percentage of what the author
earns. I would not accept an hourly fee or a flat sum. A lawyer can
be nicely paid for setting up a nonprofit or for otherwise working
on a venture that doesn't make money. But not a literary agent. For
me to prosper, my clients must prosper.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2984">That means that if I'm to benefit from
this mode of publishing, it has to be profitable, so that I can
receive some share of the profits. There's no media conglomerate
forking over fees; profits are the only money that might be
available to be divided up. I don't know if "With A Little Help"
will be profitable, but it has the potential to earn a profit. If
it doesn't, it won't be because the model is wrong, but because we
did it wrong, or because the time isn't right for it. We'll learn;
change the formula; wait for the culture or the technology to
evolve; and then come back and try it again.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2985">By volunteering some of my time and
talent to the project, I'm in a position to educate myself about
what does and doesn't work in this crucial area: generating a
profit in this new publishing model. If you want to say, "Typical
agent, only cares about money, has no soul and no taste for art,"
go right ahead. Lack of money is art's abortionist, killing off too
many God-possibled projects that are conceived but never born. I'm
here to help my clients make money. They, and the slime-molds, need
me.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2986">I hope to take what I learn and do a
better job next time, advising Cory (or other clients one day) on
how to make money from this mode of publishing. I'm trying to be as
useful to him as I can be, but I'm really preparing for a time when
this might be my primary source of commissions. I feel it
coming.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2987">In this new model, the term "literary
agent" might fall out of use, since the word "agent" means "the
person who gets you the money." Already some literary agents like
to use the word "manager" to provide a broader sense of our role as
literary counselors and not mere deal-brokers.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2988">But I like the word "agent" because it
is my job to find you the money and that shouldn't change. Managing
is simply one of the skills an agent uses to get that money in the
first place, like a used-car salesman who details the car and
changes the oil before showing it to customers. What will change is
where the money comes from and what kind of management skills I'll
need to help get it. It could be something like being a partner in
a small business — with each book its own individual small business
— and receiving a share of profits, if any. That is, of course,
already what I do, helping to run the day-to-day business of our
agency, and so it won't be that radical a change.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o2989">It might not be as much fun as calling
up some international media conglomerate, wresting a few million
dollars out of its hide, and keeping 15% for myself. I'll miss
that. In exchange, I won't have to listen to them, either, and I
won't have to devote my life to selling them only what they want to
buy, which is not necessarily what I want to represent, or what
people want to read.</p>
