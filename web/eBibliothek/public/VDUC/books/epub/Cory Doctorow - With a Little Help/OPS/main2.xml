<h3 class="section_title">A note about typos and other errors</h3>
<div class="text">
<div class="substance">
<p id="o22" class="norm">Every book has typos. <em>Every</em> book.
But this book is different. This book isn't perfect, but it
<em>fails well.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p id="o23" class="norm">If you spot a typo in this book, send it
to &lt;<a href=
"mailto:walh_typos@craphound.com">walh_typos@craphound.com</a>&gt;
(that's me) and I'll correct it in the electronic editions and in
the next copy of the print-on-demand book that's printed â€”
nigh-instantaneously.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p id="o24" class="norm">What's more, as a thank-you, I'll include
your name as a footnote on the page you fixed for me, and at the
bottom of the ebooks.</p>

<p id="o27" class="norm">It turns out the future doesn't really
care about space travel. It used to, or at least when I was growing
up all the science fiction I read promised that space travel would
someday be commonplace. That was what made it the future: we would
all be so bored with flying to other planets that we wouldn't even
really talk about it anymore, it would just become a dull backdrop
to our daily lives. There would be aliens, obviously. Probably
there would be some sort of intergalactic governing body, maybe a
war involving a trade federation, some asteroid mines. At the very
least, a mission to Mars. But it doesn't seem to be shaping up that
way.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p id="o28" class="norm">There's always something that science
fiction gets charmingly wrong about the future. The problem is,
every now and then there's an unanticipated seismic shift in the
world, something that changes everything and creates a corner we
can't see around. The most recent of these was the potent
combination of digital information and global connectivity that
transformed the end of the 20th century. I like to call it "The
Internet," and mark my words, it's going to be very big. The
struggling record industry, the death of the newspaper, the rise of
LOLCats - these are just warning shots. Everything is going to get
swallowed up eventually, and it's all going to get loud and messy
and complicated. Forget space travel, this is the future we need to
imagine now, and quickly, before it overtakes us.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p id="o29" class="norm">Luckily, we have Cory Doctorow; he thinks
about the Internet, a lot. And so his stories are especially
compelling because they are so relevant to our immediate future.
"Scroogled" warns us of what might happen if Google someday decides
that yes, actually, they would like to be evil after all. For a
future-lover like me it's easy to get caught up in rosy visions of
a world where we're all connected, and everything is free, and our
in-brain iPods have every Beatles album with all the correct
metadata. Cory's fiction reminds us that we have quite a few thorny
issues to sort out before we get there, not least of which is the
question of how people like Cory are going to make a living when
books and publishing companies disappear. But of course he's
thinking about that too.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p id="o30" class="norm">With a Little Help is an experiment of
sorts, an attempt to re-imagine what it means to publish, market
and sell a book. It will be self-published, and like all of Cory's
books it will be released under a Creative Commons license that
allows for non-commercial sharing and remixing. There will be a
number of price-points, ranging from free ebook and audiobook
downloads, to print-on-demand paperbacks, to hardcover special
editions with all sorts of extra goodies. The highest price-point
comes with an opportunity to commission a brand new story based on
a mutually agreeable premise (hence, "Epoch"). Throughout the
process Cory will hold weekly public production meetings on Twitter
in an effort to share information about the success or failure of
these strategies. The plan combines a lot of different new ideas -
audience participation, free culture, long tail economics - and it
will test a few hypotheses about what it might mean to be an author
in the future. It's a shotgun approach to innovation; as the old
business models become quaint antiques from a not-so-distant past,
sometimes the best way forward is simply to try a bunch of stuff
and see what works.</p>

<p id="o31" class="norm">At least, that was my theory when I
finally decided to become a full-time musician. I had spent years
avoiding a career in the music business because it seemed
impossible. How do people discover you if you're not famous? And
how do you get famous if nobody ever discovers you? Then I heard
about Creative Commons, a brilliant licensing hack that sits on top
of the complicated and antiquated copyright system. It allows
creators to specify ahead of time what sorts of uses they'd like to
allow for the things they create. For me and for Cory this means
allowing people to share our work freely, and to re-use it to
create new things. The first time the concept was explained to me I
felt as though someone had set my brain on fire - it was the most
exciting idea I had ever heard.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p id="o32" class="norm">In my head, songs became little autonomous
vehicles that I could release into the wild, letting them bounce
around and find their way to the people who would enjoy them. It
was a way to let this new "Internet" thing do all the heavy
lifting, an organic and efficient method of targeting an audience
of fans who did not yet know they were fans. On top of that, it was
a perfect expression of what I had always felt about art, this idea
that everything ever created owes its existence to something that
came before. To be sure, there is a boundary between inspiration
and theft, but it's a thick and mushy one. When we create, we
borrow, we build, we steal. Declaring my intentions to allow this
sort of thing, indeed to encourage it, made perfect sense. I didn't
have it all figured out, but I started licensing my music with
Creative Commons that very day. It became the first piece of the
puzzle, and it remains an essential component of the mysterious
machinery that now allows me to make my living as a musician. It
was just one of those ideas that resonated, the buzzing end of a
long wire stretching off into the distance, perhaps even around a
corner or two.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p id="o33" class="norm">Speaking of which, it's not unreasonable
to ask: as a science fiction author, what is it that Cory is
getting wrong about the future? What is the corner that he can't
see around? Certainly there's something big coming, and we'll know
it once we've gotten past it. But until then, we've got our own
rather sharp corner to turn, and we're just now getting a glimpse
of some of the possible futures that might be in store for us. Here
in the real world, where constant change seems to be the new status
quo, he's hedging against what we don't know, not just thinking
about the future, but trying to take us there.</p>
