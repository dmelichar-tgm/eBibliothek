<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1444">Hi, Mom!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1445">Wow, you won't believe what happened
today. First of all, I was nearly late for work because my new
roommate is worried about the electrical and he pulled out all the
plugs last night, even my alarm clock! His name is Tony, and I
think he is either weird or crazy, or maybe both! He keeps saying
that the Company uses the plugs to listen to our minds! He
unplugged all the electricals and put tape over them in the middle
of the night. When I woke up this morning, my room was totally
black! I had my flashlight from work on the chair near my bed, and
I used that to find the living room. Tony was sitting in his shorts
on the sofa, in the dark, watching the plug behind the TV. Hey, I
said, you watch the television, not the plug, and then he said some
bad words and told me that he didn't want me plugging in
<i>anything</i>. He is skinny like Jimmy got when he had the AIDS,
but he is not sick, he is hyperkinetic, like Manny was when he went
to the special school. That is why he is management and I still
work on a truck. If I have to be skinny and crazy to be management,
I'll take the truck all day long!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1446">So I got dressed and ran out of the apt
and took all those stairs up to the slidewalk because there was a
big line up of people waiting for the elevators, like always, and I
didn't have time to wait, because my watch was already warning me
that I was going to be late as if I didn't know! I ran all the way
to the garage, around all the people on the slidewalk, who don't
know to walk right and stand left like you always told me. Life up
here in the city is different from back home and no doubt at
all.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1447">My watch knew that I wasn't in the
garage at 8:25 and it started counting down the minutes till I was
late. Its voice gets higher and higher and more and more excited as
I get closer to being late, and I thought it was going to bust
something as I ran through the door of the garage. It told me that
I'd had a close call, but I'd made it, and I felt pretty good about
that.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1448">Wendell, the day supervisor, smiled at
me when I came in, which he <i>never</i> does, and I got nervous
that maybe my watch was wrong about my being late, except that my
watch is never wrong. Jap, he said, you're on special truck 982
today. I said what's that, and he told me that it was a great honor
and then he said I'd like you to meet your pusher for today,
Rhindquist.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1449">So I shook Rhindquist's hand. He was a
kind of old, fat, short guy, and his uniform was old fashioned
looking and not as smart as the one I wear, that you liked so much
in the photo I sent home last month. So right away I thought that
he was some kind of moron and I was being punished for being late.
He said, pleased to meet you, Jasper, and he didn't sound like a
moron, but more like one of those guys on your TV stories that are
rich and powerful and in charge. I said call me Jap everybody else
does and he said twenty years ago the All Nippon Anti Defamation
League would have put a stop to that and I laughed even though I
didn't get the joke until later. It is that Jap is also short for
Japanese, which is like the Moonies but they are from Korea.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1450">Let's roll 'em out, Rhindquist said, and
hopped on the back of the truck and held on tight. I got in and did
my ten point startup safety check like they taught me. By point
four, he was banging on the side of the truck and saying Let's go!
and I leaned out my window and said that I wouldn't skip my safety
check for nobody and he said some bad words and I said that I would
have to start over again and he'd better keep quiet or we'd never
get out of there. My watch said I did right, which made me feel
good. I hoped that Rhindquist's watch told him off for trying to
shortcut on safety!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1451">We rolled out a little late. I drove to
my first pickup, which is the side of Finance 38. Finance 38 is a
very, very tall building and all no windows because they don't want
spies from other cities seeing them and their money. I drove over
the Severe Tire Damage yard and passed through three security gates
and backed up to the shredder bay. I did my four point shutdown
safety check and Rhindquist banged on the truck again and said more
bad words but I ignored him. His watch must be busy all the time,
telling him not to be so mean!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1452">I went through the metal-detector and
into the Finance 38 and the guard's watch and my watch talked to
each other for a while and then the guard stopped pointing his gun
at me and said, You're late now move this stuff out of here and I
said OK and started moving the boxes. Finance 38's boxes are very
heavy, and there sure are a lot of them! Every day, there are fifty
boxes, as big as the big TV at the community centre back home. I am
getting very strong working at this job, Mom! My arms are bigger
every morning.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1453">I moved the boxes back to the truck. I
left them for Rhindquist, who started opening them and pushing the
papers inside into the hopper. On my normal truck, 3528, my pusher
is Vasquez, who is very fast at pushing the papers. Rhindquist was
slow, so that by the time I'd moved half the boxes back to the
truck, there was no more room to be move the rest! I thought that
for a guy who's always in a big hurry, he sure works slow!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1454">So I went into the truck, with my
flashlight. And there was Rhindquist, and do you know what he was
doing? He was reading the papers before putting them into the
shredder! What are you doing? I said, you aren't allowed to do
that! He gave me a look, not like he was angry, but like he thought
<i>I</i> was a moron or something. My watch told me that I should
report him right away, and I started to go back into Finance 38 to
use the guard's phone, but Rhindquist did something with his own
watch and my watch stopped working! You broke my watch! I said to
him!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1455">He said, That's from the Blues Brothers,
and he said, What do they do, attach the disposal baskets to the
laser printers? This is all junk, none of this needs secure
disposal! And I said, you broke my watch, Rhindquist, and
everything in the Finance Buildings needs secure disposal, it's in
the manual.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1456">He said, I didn't break your watch, I
just shut it off for a while. It will be OK, trust me. Come here,
have a look at this.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1457">Mom, I did it! I read the paper in his
hand, with my flashlight. It said, Johnson, your performance review
has been rescheduled for 1630h on Friday, 78th floor boardroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1458">This is crap! Rhindquist said. This
doesn't need secure disposal. He kept digging through the papers,
and looking at them before shoving them in the shredder. Every time
he looked at one, he said, Crap, and then put it in. I couldn't
stop watching. I thought we were going to be fired! Or put in jail!
Then he said, Aha! He showed me the paper, it said, CONFIDENTIAL at
the top, and I felt like I was going to sick up, I was so scared.
It said RE ORG CHART, and it had lots of names with dotted lines
connecting them to other names. Rhindquist winked at me and put it
in his pocket â€” his old-fashioned uniform had pockets!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1459">I thought I figured it out then.
Rhindquist was a spy from another city! They talked about spies in
Basic Training, and what to do when you found one. You are supposed
to make sure they won't go anywhere, then contact security. So I
ran as quick as I could out of the truck and slammed the door and
security-locked it from the outside, and then I climbed over all
the boxes of unshredded documents from Finance 38 and ran to the
security guard. I said, there's a spy in my truck, and he's reading
the papers! And he said, What? I said, My pusher is a spy! I caught
him reading the papers and putting them in his pockets! The
security guard looked like he thought I was crazy! I said, Really!
And he picked up his phone and spoke in Securitese to the other
security guards and then there were sirens and lots of cars and
guards with armor and guns, Mom!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1460">They surrounded the truck and unlocked
it and Rhindquist stepped out with his hands in his pockets. He
said, Quality Auditor, boys, radio it in. The security guards
looked like they wanted to shoot him, but one of them talked into
his phone and then shouted out at all the security guards in
Securitese and they went away!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1461">Rhindquist walked over to me and said,
Jap, you aren't the brightest bulb on the marquee, but you think
fast and you follow orders. I said, I am as smart as the next
person and I do my job. I said to the security guard from Finance
38, aren't you going to arrest him, he's a spy!? And the security
guard said, Look, he's management. He's allowed to do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1462">And Rhindquist put his arm around my
shoulders and said, You're stuck in a loop, son. New data: I'm not
a spy, I'm your boss, and you did right, even if you have blown the
audit. How'd you like a promotion?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1463">And I said, you're management?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1464">And then, do you know what? He said,
Jap, my boy-o, I am Rhindquist J McBride, CEO, President, and
Chairman of the Board of the File-O-Gator Corporation, The
Incorporated Township of File-O-Gator, Ontario, and File-O-Gator
International Holdings, Limited. I'm <i>in charge</i>!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1465">Hi Mom!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1466">Thanks for the pictures from Buddy's
wedding. He sure looks handsome in a suit! You're right, he should
dress nice more!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1467">I'm dressing nice, too. Rhindquist J
McBride has made me a Special Vice President! I'm management! Not
management like my crazy roommate, Tony, who isn't my roommate
anymore. They moved him and gave me the whole apt to myself, and I
can plug in anything I want to, whenever I want to! I'm Real Brass!
I only drive my old truck number 3528 two days a week now, and
Vasquez has a different driver who I've never met the other four
days. Vasquez says he is not as careful as I am, and sometimes, he
makes them late! And he says, now that I'm running the show, can I
make sure that his performance appraisal shows that it's the new
guy's fault? I said I would look into it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1468">I haven't had a chance to look into it
yet, because the other four days, I go to Operations 1 and sit in a
beautiful office on the top floor, one hundred floors above ground!
They keep me busy, Mom! Rhindquist comes into my office and sits in
the chair by the door, and talks on his phone, and asks me all
kinds of crazy questions, like, Do I think that the pinheads in HR
know their ass from a hole in the ground? And I say Yes, and he
says, What makes you think so?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1469">So I told him about Basic Training, and
how I learned the history of File-O-Gator, and memorized our Vision
Statement, which is, The File-O-Gator Organization is a diverse
multinational sovereign power that is a World-Class Leader in its
fields of Operations, a status it has achieved through the
diligence and responsibility of its Human Resources, which are the
Heart of every Organization. I told him about how the HR Sergeant
was always fair about our Training Appraisals, and how he always
knew when someone had been goofing in the showers and made sure
that they got disciplined. And I told him about how I played the
Anthill Simulator and learned how the one drone doesn't know why
he's moving a grain of sand, but that from the Queen's seat in the
middle, it all makes sense. I told him that whenever my watch asks
me to do something I didn't understand, or when something weird
happens to me, like my crazy roommate Tony covering up all the
plugs, that I remember the Anthill Simulator and I do my job.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1470">Rhindquist laughed and said Jap, my
bright boy, you are a treasure, a walking focus-group. I'm not
paying you enough. And then he gave me a raise! He called someone
on his phone and said, Give my boy a raise, and they did! I am
sending home a little money as an attachment with this note, and a
picture of me in my Special Vice-President's suit.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1471">Every afternoon, Rhindquist shuts off
his phone and my watch, and a pretty secretary wheels in a big TV.
We watch movies! Rhindquist says he likes to unwind with a movie at
the end of the day. The movies are old and funny, and I've never
seen them before. Rhindquist sure has, though! He knows most of
them by heart! Yesterday, we watched one called Educating Rita, and
Rhindquist told me that I am like Rita. I already had that figured
out, though. Rita is a dumb girl from England, Ltd., and she works
as a hairdresser until someone from management teaches her all
about life. I liked the movie a lot. I think that Rhindquist will
teach me lots and lots about management, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1472">My crazy old roommate Tony works in
Operations 1, too, in the basement. I know this because this
morning I saw him getting off the slidewalk and going to the
basement elevators. He sure looked worried. I ran up to him and
said Hi and he looked at me in my suit and his eyes bugged out and
then he said Hi, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1473">I told Rhindquist about him, and he said
that he thought Tony had interesting prospects and he would keep an
eye on him. I tried to tell him about Vasquez and the new guy but
then his phone rang and he talked for a long time. He sounded
angry, and he shouted that he didn't care what it took â€” get him
Redmond! Even if you have to nuke it! I have a small TV on my desk,
and I used it to look up Redmond, but it kept saying, See
Microsoft. I asked Rhindquist about it and he said that Redmond is
what Microsoft used to be called before they incorporated. He is
always talking like that, calling things by their old names.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1474">It was quitting time then, so I went
home and wrote you this letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1475">Hi Mom!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1476">I am real sorry to hear about Buddy. I
know he must feel sad. I didn't think that Carla was a spy, either,
but now that she's been arrested, I guess that Buddy should feel
lucky that he didn't stay married to her long enough to have little
spy babies!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1477">This is my third week as Special Vice
President. I'm doing well for myself! Crazy Tony is now my
assistant! He sits at a smaller desk in my office with me and
Rhindquist, and Rhindquist asks him the same crazy questions he
asks me, but Tony's answers are always weird. He has been in
management stream since the second grade, and he has read all kinds
of TV that I've never even heard of. Rhindquist doesn't know about
it, either. He says that Tony is paranoid, which means that he
thinks everyone is out to get him. Tony said that even paranoids
have enemies, and Rhindquist laughed so much, I thought he would
bust.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1478">Some days, Rhindquist is very sad, and
on those days, we just watch movies. I've seen My Fair Lady,
Pygmalion, Trading Places, The Prince and the Pauper, and a whole
bunch more. They are all about poor people like you and me who
become rich and powerful like Rhindquist. Mom, I think it means
that Rhindquist wants me to be in charge! I haven't said anything,
but I am trying to get ready. I am learning Word Power at night
with the TV in my apt. I am not using it yet, because I want to
make sure I am very good at it before I do.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1479">I told Rhindquist about Vasquez and the
new guy, and do you know what he did? He sat down at my desk and he
opened up Vasquez's file on my TV and he gave him Excellents in all
of his Appraisal Categories! Can you believe it? There's nothing he
can't do! He said, You gotta give the working stiffs a Christmas
present now and then, right, Jap? I said, Sure.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1480">But I don't know. The Performance
Appraisals are supposed to be <i>scrupulously</i> fair â€” that's one
of my Power Words, it means <i>very</i>. It doesn't seem right to
just treat them like a bunch of numbers. It's Vasquez's whole life!
It's good that Rhindquist gave him all Excellents, because that
means that he'll probably be promoted this year, maybe he'll end up
a dispatcher or even a trainer. But what if Rhindquist had decided
to put Needs Improvements down? It would have ruined Vasquez for
the rest of his life! It's full of arbitrary â€” that means that it
doesn't make sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1481">I haven't talked to Rhindquist about
this. I don't want to seem stupid. Tony and I talked about it on
the slidewalk, though. He said that I was very stupid if I still
believed that Performance Appraisals meant anything. He said that
the only Appraisal that counts is the one they get from reading
your mind. I laughed and called him paranoid. He said, I take that
shit from Rhindquist but I don't have to take it from an ignorant
farm-boy like you. I got scared for a second, and then I remembered
that I was Tony's boss! Tony, I said, I should fire you on the
spot. (That was from one of the movies we watched) Then <i>he</i>
looked scared and he said Sorry, sorry! I said, What makes you
think anyone could read your mind?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1482">And he said, What makes you think they
can't? I said, Well, if Rhindquist could read my mind, he would
have known that I was going to call out Security the day we met, at
Finance 38. Tony said, Rhindquist is just a puppet of the Ones In
Charge. They pull his strings and he dances for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1483">I said I didn't understand and Tony
looked at me with pity. He said, The Ones In Charge are running all
the cities, Microsoft and England and BBD&amp;O and Red Stripe.
They know everything that's going on. This is all a game for
them.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1484">And I said, Boy, you don't know
anything! BBD&amp;O is our biggest enemy! File-O-Gator is locked in
a death-struggle with them, it said so on the news this
morning!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1485">Jap, Tony said, we're not fighting
BBD&amp;O â€” File-O-Gator is. <i>We're</i> riding a slidewalk back
home. Can't you tell the difference between fighting and riding a
slidewalk?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1486">And I said, Of course I can! That's full
of sophistry! (Another Power Word, which means cow-patties) We're
part of File-O-Gator. File-O-Gator is fighting BBD&amp;O. That
means we're fighting BBD&amp;O, Ergo. (That means, So there!)</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1487">Tony laughed and said, That's where
you're wrong! File-O-Gator is just the long arm of one of the Ones
In Charge. He probably slept with the wife of the One In Charge who
runs BBD&amp;O, and now they're fighting it out.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1488">I laughed at Tony and said, You keep
talking about the Ones In Charge! Everything you say is stupid
unless you believe in the Ones In Charge! What makes you think that
there are any Ones In Charge?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1489">There <i>has</i> to be, Tony said. Who
else is running the show?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1490">Rhindquist is! I said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1491">Tony looked at me like I was stupid. I'm
pretty sick of him looking at me like that. Tony said, If
Rhindquist is running the show, then how come he has time to waste
on you?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1492">I wanted to say something, but I didn't
know what. Tony sure makes me angry! I got off the slidewalk and
went home and wrote you this letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1493">Hi Mom!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1494">Gosh, poor Buddy! How can <i>he</i> be a
spy? I played with him all my life! I never saw him being a spy!
He'd have to be pretty sneaky to be a spy! I don't think he's a
spy! I'm sure that the manager at his disciplinary hearing will
figure out that he couldn't be a spy!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1495">I am learning Power Punctuation now. I
have been using my Power Words with Rhindquist all week, but he
doesn't seem to notice. I think that if I start sending him Written
Reports that are Power Punctuated, he'll notice that I'm really
making effortful progress!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1496">Today, Rhindquist sent Tony back to his
old office to bring up all their Secure Document Storage
Containers. It was the first time that Rhindquist and I were alone
together since Tony was made my assistant, and I had a private talk
with Rhindquist.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1497">I said, "Are you really in charge?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1498">Rhindquist stared at me. "What is that
supposed to mean?" he asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1499">I said, "Tony says that 'If you were 'in
charge;' that you wouldn't have time to squander with us. He says:
'You're just a puppet of the 'Ones In Charge''"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1500">Rhindquist smiled and shook his head. He
said: "Tony thinks he's pretty smart â€” huh?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1501">I smiled back at him because I thought
he thought Tony was crazy. "He sure does!" I said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1502">Rhindquist said: "Well, even 'paranoids'
have enemies!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1503">I said, "Wow! Do you mean: 'Tony is
right?'!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1504">He said, "Well, no one except weirdos
like me would want to know what's in Tony's brain, so I don't think
he really has to worry about anyone reading his mind! But he's
right about one thing: even though I'm in charge of File-O-Gator,
I'm not necessarily running the show. I have <i>investors</i>. Pray
God you never meet them, Jap. They'd eat you alive."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1505">I said, "But they taught me in Basic
that you started File-O-Gator with just one truck and a shredder!
And that you shrewdly parlayed your meager holdings into a powerful
organization by strategically deploying your human resources!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1506">He laughed! "Strategically deploying
human resources? I paid the mob to scare the s**t out of the guys
driving the other trucks!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1507">I thought that the drivers of the other
trucks must've been pretty gutless if they let someone scare them
away from their appointed responsibilities, but I didn't say
so.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1508">Rhindquist looked at me like he was
sorry he'd said what he said. "Oh, I didn't <i>hurt</i> anyone.
Just put the fear of God in them. Then I picked up their routes,
borrowed some cash, bought some more trucks, and the rest is
history. I just sort of stumbled along with it, best as I
could.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1509">"Sometimes, I wonder how it all
happened. One minute, you're shredding papers in Toronto, the next,
you're buying the place! I can't see that I was a whole lot smarter
than any of the other guys who were doing the same thingâ€¦ I did
design the uniforms, though. They were pretty sharp â€” nicer than
the potato-sacks you guys wear these days."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1510">I like my uniform, Mom, and I wear it
with pride. If it had been crazy Tony making fun of my uniform, I
would have maybe hit him, but when Rhindquist said it, I just had
to look like I understood and smile at him.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1511">I said, "You've done a lot more than
design the uniforms! You run the show! You said so!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1512">He looked at me like I was a little kid
and shook his head. "If I was running the show, would I be amusing
myself by pulling random Quality Audits on the trucks?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1513">Crazy Tony walked in then. He looked at
us and said, "What?! What are you two talking about?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1514">Rhindquist said, "Jap here was just
explaining to me how you don't think I'm in charge." Tony looked
scared and Rhindquist winked at me.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1515">Tony looked at me like he wanted to kill
me!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1516">Tony said, "Do you really want to
discuss this? Here? In this place, with all the ears and eyes in
this room?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1517">Rhindquist laughed and laughed and
laughed. "Ears and eyes? Tony, you're beautiful, you twisty little
weirdo. A real laugh riot."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1518">Tony's face got red and he looked fit to
bust. "Fine, then. Let's talk. Talk about the Calabrese and the
Gnomes and the Tongs and the Masons and the Posses! How'd you like
that?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1519">Rhindquist tried to stop laughing, but
he couldn't. "Jap, there's nothing more dangerous than a little
knowledge!" He didn't say it to me, though, he said it to Tony.
Tony was so angry, he shook!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1520">Just then, Rhindquist's phone rang. He
said, "McBride here," which is how he always answers. Then he said,
"Yes, sir! That's fabulous!" He covered the bottom of the phone and
said, "Why don't you guys take the rest of the day off, huh?" And
then he opened the door and sent us out!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1521">When I got home, my TV was already on,
with a Special Bulletin: BBD&amp;O was our sister city, and the two
of us were fighting a life-and-death battle with Microsoft. There
was also a message from Rhindquist, and attached to it was a copy
of another old movie, 1984.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1522">It was boring.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1523">Hi Mom!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1524">I can't believe it! They gave Buddy
life? Jeez! I'm going to talk to Rhindquist about this â€” this is
ridiculous!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1525">Today was Tuesday, so I was on the truck
with Vasquez. I got to the garage nice and early, and my watch
congratulated me. It kind-of bothered me. I guess I'm just getting
used to working in my office, with the watch switched off.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1526">By the time we made our first stop, at
HR 102, I was ready to throw my watch out the window! It had told
me <i>eight times</i> how great I was: when I got to the garage;
when I did my safety-check; when I stopped at three red lights;
when I backed up to the document disposal dock; when I cleared
security; and when I lifted the boxes with my legs instead of my
back. To tell you the truth, it made me feel pretty stupid. I felt
like I was a puppy, getting patted on the head.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1527">By lunch, my watch had given me 57
positive feedbacks. I mentioned it to Vasquez.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1528">He said, "I don't know what you're
complaining about. It beats having it shout at you all the time. It
just means you're doing all right. When I'm out with the new guy,
this thing never shuts up. It just yammers on and on about how late
we are, how many more pickups we have to do, what percent of our
pickups we've been late for. I got so mad last week, I shouted at
it: 'Don't tell me! Tell the retard who's driving!'"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1529">We both laughed at that. I said, "Sure,
it's better to get loved-off than it is to get chewed-out, but
don't you feel like an idiot, having a machine telling you what a
great job you're doing?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1530">My watch said that I was lowering morale
and I should stop. I got so angry, Mom! I told it to mind its own
business! It said that it <i>was</i> minding its own business and
did I want it to connect me with a maintenance operator to evaluate
its judgment?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1531">I'd never mouthed-off to my watch
before. The idea of talking to a real person about it scared me,
but I remembered that even though I was driving a truck, I was also
a Special Vice president, and that made me almost everybody's boss.
I said, "Yes!" Vasquez looked at me like I'd gone nuts!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1532">A few seconds later, a new voice came
out of my watch. "How can I help you, Mr Whitehead?" The voice was
smooth and oily, like the man from Physical Plant who used to come
around to collect the rent back home.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1533">All of a sudden, I didn't know what to
say. I said, "My watch is irritating me."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1534">The voice said, "Have you developed a
rash? Is there visible chafing?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1535">I said, "No. It's irritating me
mentally. It never shuts up."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1536">The voice didn't say anything for a
while, then it said, "Well, from my records, I see that you have a
98% positive-feedback-index. In fact, your watch hasn't given you
any corrective feedback in weeks, with the exception of a mild
correction about anti-morale speculations."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1537">I felt stupid, like one of those guys in
Basic who carped about every little thing. I said, "Well, I'm just
getting tired of having a machine tell me when I'm right and when
I'm wrong. I can figure that out on my own."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1538">The voice said, "I see." And then it
didn't say anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1539">I tried to wait until the voice said
something else, but the quiet made me very nervous. I said, "I
don't mean to be rude or anything. I am very conscientious about my
job. It's just that I feel like a moron or something, always having
the watch tell me what I'm doing." I knew that I wasn't expressing
myself very well, but I couldn't remember any of my Power Words
just then. "It bugs me, you know?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1540">The voice said, "I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid that that's not my business. I'm in maintenance. If you have
a concern about HR policy, you'll need to take it up with
them."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1541">I thought about my HR Sergeant in Basic,
and tried to imagine telling him that I didn't want my watch to
talk to me anymore, and nearly jumped out of my skin. "That's OK,"
I said. "My lunch is almost over. I'll try them after my
shift."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1542">The voice said, "Thank you for calling
Maintenance! Have a nice day!" Then my watch told me it was time to
get in the truck and start driving again.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1543">Vasquez kept looking at me all day like
I was some kind of crazy.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1544">Hi Mom!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1545">Tell Buddy he doesn't have to keep on
calling me to say thanks. I'm just glad that he and Carla are all
right. Tell him to enjoy his promotion!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1546">When I got to the office this morning, I
found Rhindquist wearing his old-fashioned pusher's uniform. I
hadn't seen it since the day we met. I was surprised by how normal
he looked in it: he could have been any pusher.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1547">"Well, aren't you dressed for success?"
I asked him ironically.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1548">He spun around and said, "I've got
something new. For three of the days that you're here, I'll be on a
truck with Vasquez. You fill in for me, take any calls, handle any
business. Order up some movies. We'll meet up on the fourth day
here and I'll answer any questions you have. If something urgent
comes up, give me a call."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1549">I felt a little out of my depth, but I
wanted to demonstrate my take-charge attitude to Rhindquist, so I
smiled and said, "Can-do, boss! Knock 'em dead!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1550">Tony came in and snorted a snide laugh
at Rhindquist. Rhindquist raised an eyebrow at me, and I took the
hint. "What are you smirking at, mister?" I barked, like my old
Sarge. "You find something amusing about the official uniform of a
representative of this organization?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1551">He cast his eyes down and mumbled
"No."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1552">I was enjoying myself. I said, "I can't
hear you, mister!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1553">Tony looked at me, his eyes focused in
space beside my head. "No, sir!" he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1554">"Get downstairs and see what the
pinheads on the third floor are shredding. Sort it, box it, and
have it on my desk by lunch, hear me?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1555">"Yes, sir!" Tony shouted and hustled out
of my office.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1556">Rhindquist shook his head and looked
admiringly at me. "Sonny-boy, you're going to do just fine," he
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1557">"You know it!" I said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1558">Rhindquist gave me a big thumbs-up and
left me alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1559">So there I was, alone, in my office, in
charge. Sort of.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1560">I played with my TV for a while. The TV
at the office gave me all kinds of access that I didn't have at
home. I clicked on something, and there were the personnel files! I
felt like a snoop, but it was too fun to stop. I opened my file,
and Vasquez's, and a whole bunch more. Boy, the Company sure knows
a lot about us! My file went all the way back to the Infirmary
where I was born, and then I clicked on your name, and there was
everything about you!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1561">Mom, I didn't know you had your tubes
tied!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1562">I followed our family tree up and down,
and I came to Buddy. His file was spotless, all the way up to the
spying thing. I clicked on the name of the Security Manager who'd
"caught" him, and do you know what? He was engaged to Carla last
year! Carla is his ex-girlfriend!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1563">Well, it was pretty easy to see what was
going on, let me tell you. Buddy got married to Carla, and her
ex-boyfriend had them locked up. I tell you, I was so angry, I felt
like I would bust. But I'm smarter than that. All it took was a few
minutes' typing and wham, I'd gotten Buddy and Carla out of jail,
given them promotions, and had the Security Manager busted down to
a janitor. I bet that confused him!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1564">So it really wasn't much. It scares me
to have that much power, Mom, but it feels good, too. I made sure
that all my friends back home were set up all right, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1565">You just wait till your Christmas bonus,
Mom!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1566">Tony came up at lunchtime, with three
big boxes of papers. He'd sorted out the memos, personal documents
and the inter-departmental communications. They were pretty
interesting reading! Especially the personal documents: shopping
lists, letters home, love-notes and gossip. It was like being the
queen ant, sitting in the middle of the hill, seeing what all the
drones were up to. I sent Tony out to get some more.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1567">It was getting onto movie time when the
phone on my desk rang. I answered it, "Jasper Whitehead, Special
Vice-President."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1568">The person on the phone shouted at me,
"Get me McBride, now!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1569">I felt sick. I said, "I'm sorry, he's
not available right now. I'm filling in for him. Can I be of
service?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1570">The person laughed at me. "Well, maybe
you can at that, son! Rhindquist has been promising to do something
for me for months now, I guess he's just been too busy. Do you have
his access codes?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1571">I said I did, and turned on my TV.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1572">"Good boy," he said. "Now, I want to
find docket 09.3457. You know how to open a docket?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1573">I told him I did and found the docket.
It was called "Microsoft," and it had a long Action-Item List
attached to it. I didn't really get most of the Action Items, but
they were all checked off except one.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1574">"OK â€” there's an unchecked item at the
bottom of that list. It's called, 'Deploy Strategic Negotiation
Tool.' You see it?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1575">I said I did.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1576">"Check it off," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1577">I did. The TV asked me if I was sure. I
said I was. The TV asked me again. I said I was, again. I told the
man I was done.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1578">"Good kid. Thanks! Tell McBride I like
his new hire."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1579">He laughed again and hung up before I
could say "You're welcome."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1580">My phone rang again. It was a reporter
from PR 43, and she wanted to know all about my dynamic leadership
in handling the Microsoft Crisis. I didn't really understand the
question, but they taught me what to say to the press in Basic. I
said, "The File-O-Gator Organization is a diverse multinational
sovereign power that is a World-Class Leader in its fields of
Operations, a status it has achieved through the diligence and
responsibility of its Human Resources, which are the Heart of every
Organization."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1581">The reporter sounded impressed. I
thanked her and hung up and turned on the TV and flipped around.
There was a reporter lady on the screen, showing satellite maps of
Microsoft, like a weather map. Except that instead of lighting
bolts or a smiling sun, there were tanks and soldiers and flames.
The TV said that bold directives from Special Vice-President Jasper
Whitehead had brought an end to the Microsoft conflict. It said
that a classified number of File-O-Gator troops had occupied the
conflict-zone, deploying strategic neurotoxins and nonlethal
influenza vectors, resulting in an estimated 85%
compliance-and-conversion rate among the Microsoftians.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1582">Tony came in with more boxes and looked
at me. He said, "God, what's eating you?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1583">I told him. I didn't know what else to
do. I thought that maybe I could get Rhindquist on the phone, but
he'd left me in charge.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1584">Tony smiled, but it wasn't a happy
smile. "Well, there you go. You've made your first executive
decision."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1585">I said, "I didn't make any
decision!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1586">He just laughed and pointed to the TV,
which was showing pictures of a city just like File-O-Gator, the
buildings all collapsed and burning. He said, "Sure looks like an
executive decision to me." The picture panned over an apartment
building that was split down the middle, the apartments naked and
exposed, the people who lived there dead and sprawled or alive and
hanging over the edge, vomiting.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1587">Oh, those poor people!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1588">I didn't know what I was doing!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1589">I spent all last night throwing up, and
I'm not sure if I'm going to go to the office today.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1590">Hi Mom!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1591">Well, I didn't go to work yesterday.
Instead, I got out of bed, sat on the sofa in my shorts, and turned
on the movies. My watch got loud and angry, so I stuck it
underneath my pillow. Then, messages started appearing on my TV. I
ignored them. I ate some cereal around 11, and I threw it up right
away, so I stopped trying.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1592">Someone knocked on my door after lunch,
but I was watching a good part in Wall Street, so I didn't answer
it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1593">I fell asleep after Wall Street, and
woke up after 18h, because someone was really giving my door a
pounding.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1594">I opened the door, not caring that I was
wearing my shorts. It was Rhindquist. He looked sad, and beaten.
You know what he did? He gave me a hug! Boy, that was weird.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1595">He came in and sat on the sofa. I sat
next to him. He didn't say anything, just picked up the remote and
put on a funny movie, Blazing Saddles. When that was over, he put
on The Princess Bride. I never laughed so much!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1596">We watched movies all night. They were
all funny. They took my mind off things. We both fell asleep,
sitting on the sofa, but when I woke up, I was in bed, and
Rhindquist had put the blanket over me. He was asleep on the sofa.
His phone was on the TV, and its batteries were on the floor.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1597">I was really hungry, so I ate three
bowls of cereal and some toast and an apple, and I must've woken
Rhindquist up, because he came into the kitchen.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1598">"Little man, you had a busy day, huh?"
he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1599">I said, "I can't do it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1600">He got a GatorCola out of my fridge and
drank it. It was pretty strange to have the CEO of the whole
Company drinking a Goke in my kitchen for breakfast. It really made
him seem like you and me, not like a powerful guy from the
stories.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1601">He burped.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1602">He said, "I understand."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1603">I said, "Why did you do this to me?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1604">He said, "You've been in my shoes now.
Wouldn't you do anything to get out of them?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1605">I said, "But why <i>me</i>?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1606">He sighed. He said, "This sounds worse
than I mean it. I thought you were ignorant enough to enjoy
it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1607">I said, "Thanks a lot." Is there anyone
out there who <i>doesn't</i> think I'm a retard?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1608">He said, "I don't mean it in a bad way,
really. I thought you were naive enough to just do the job, take
the perks, and sleep well at night. I was wrong. You're too
smart."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1609">It didn't make me feel any better. I
went back and sat on the sofa and put on a movie,
Horsefeathers.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1610">Rhindquist watched the movie with me,
and when it was over, he said, "You don't have to do the job."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1611">I said, "So what now? You pick some
other poor retard and give him the old screw-job?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1612">He said, "I guess so."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1613">I said, "In that case, I'll do it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1614">His mouth dropped. He sat down and put
on a movie, Pink Flamingos. What a sick movie!</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1615">When it was over, he said, "In that
case, I'll do it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1616">And then I had the best idea I've ever
had. It was so good, I couldn't say anything for five whole
minutes. Mom, you sure didn't raise any idiots!</p>

there and he had on his mad face for the other guys but when me and
Rhindquist got on the truck, he smiled and winked at us.</p>

<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1620">I drove and Rhindquist hung onto the
back and he shouted at me to go faster and I just ignored him! He
kept on shouting saying, You pinhead my grandma drives faster than
you do and she's been dead for years! And that made me laugh so
hard I nearly rolled the truck and Rhindquist nearly fell off and
he was pretty quiet after that!</p>

<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1621">We got to Finance 38 and I started
lifting the boxes and Rhindquist as usual took too long to push
them. The security guard and me both laughed at the big pile of
boxes outside the truck, and he offered me a smoke, but I said no
thanks.</p>

<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1622">I went inside and told Rhindquist to Get
it in gear! And he just tossed me the paper he was reading. It said
MEMO TO ALL EMPLOYEES REGARDING NEW SECURITY MEASURES. And
underneath, it said, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY ALL AC OUTLETS ARE TO BE
COVERED WHEN NOT IN USE.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1623">We laughed and laughed and laughed, and
then my watch blipped back on even though Rhindquist had turned it
off! It said, "Laugh it up, retards!" in Tony's voice.</p>

<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1624">Rhindquist put his arm around my
shoulders and said Jap my prodigy, when you are right, you are
<i>right</i>. He's the perfect man for the job.</p>

<p class="norm" id="o1626">This is the first story I ever sold to
Patrick Nielsen Hayden, who also bought "The Things that Make Me
Weak and Strange Get Engineered Away" and all of my novels. I wrote
it in one big gulp while shut in at a hotel room in Montreal on a
business trip. It was snowing outside, and I could see the
shredding vans moving through the streets below, and I typed and
typed until my hands hurt.</p>
