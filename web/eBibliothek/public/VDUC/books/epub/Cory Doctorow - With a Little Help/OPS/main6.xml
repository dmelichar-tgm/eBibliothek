<p class="norm" id="o577">"Give me six lines written by the most
honorable of men, and I will find an excuse in them to hang him." -
Cardinal Richelieu</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o578">Greg landed at SFO at 8PM, but by the
time he made it to the front of the customs line it was after
midnight. He had it good — he'd been in first class, first off the
plane, brown as a nut and loose-limbed after a month on the beach
at Cabo, SCUBA diving three days a week, bumming around and
flirting with French college girls the rest of the time. When he'd
left San Francisco a month before, he'd been a stoop-shouldered,
pot-bellied wreck — now he was a bronze god, drawing appreciative
looks from the stews at the front of the plane.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o579">In the four hours he spent in the customs
line, he fell from god back to man. His warm buzz wore off, the
sweat ran down the crack of his ass, and his shoulders and neck
grew so tense that his upper back felt like a tennis racket. The
batteries on his iPod died after the third hour, leaving him with
nothing to do except eavesdrop on the middle-aged couple ahead of
him.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o580">"They've starting googling us at the
border," she said. "I told you they'd do it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o581">"I thought that didn't start until next
month?" The man had brought a huge sombrero on board, carefully
stowing it in its own overhead locker, and now he was stuck
alternately wearing it and holding it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o582">Googling at the border. Christ. Greg
vested out from Google six months before, cashing in his options
and "taking some me time," which turned out to be harder than he
expected. Five months later, what he'd mostly done is fix his
friends' PCs and websites, and watch daytime TV, and gain ten
pounds, which he blamed on being at home, instead of in the
Googleplex, with its excellent 24-hour gym.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o583">The writing had been on the wall. Google
had a whole pod of lawyers in charge of dealing with the world's
governments, and scumbag lobbyists on the Hill to try to keep the
law from turning them into the world's best snitch. It was a losing
battle. The US Government had spent $15 <i>billion</i> on a program
to fingerprint and photograph visitors at the border, and hadn't
caught <i>a single</i> terrorist. Clearly, the public sector was
not equipped to Do Search Right.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o584">The DHS officers had bags under their
eyes as they squinted at their screens, prodding mistrustfully at
their keyboards with sausage fingers. No wonder it was taking four
hours to get out of the goddamned airport.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o585">"Evening," he said, as he handed the man
his sweaty passport. The man grunted and swiped it, then stared at
his screen, clicking. A lot. He had a little bit of dried food in
the corner of his mouth and his tongue crept out and licked at it
as he concentrated.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o586">"Want to tell me about June, 1998?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o587">Greg turned rotated his head this way and
that. "I'm sorry?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o588">"You posted a message to alt.burningman
on June 17, 1998 about your plan to attend Burning Man. You posted,
'Would taking shrooms be a really bad idea?'"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o589">It was 3AM before they let him out of the
"secondary screening" room. The interrogator was an older man, so
skinny he looked like he'd been carved out of wood. His questions
went a lot further than the Burning Man shrooms. They were just the
start of Greg's problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o590">"I'd like to know more about your
hobbies. Are you interested in model rocketry?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o591">"What?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o592">"Model rocketry."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o593">"No," Greg said. "No, I'm not." Thinking
of all the explosives that model rocketry people surrounded
themselves with.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o594">The man made a note, clicked some more.
"You see, I ask because I see a heavy spike of ads for model
rocketry supplies showing up alongside your search results and
Google mail."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o595">Greg felt his guts spasm. "You're looking
at my searches and email?" He hadn't touched a keyboard in a month,
but he knew that what you put into the searchbar was more intimate
than what you told your father-confessor. He'd seen enough queries
to know that.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o596">"Calm down, please. No, I'm not looking
at your searches." The man made a bitter lemon face and went on in
a squeaky voice. "That would be <i>unconstitutional</i>. You
weren't listening to me. We see the <i>ads</i> that show up when
you read your mail and do your searching. I have a brochure
explaining it, I'll give it to you when we're through here."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o597">"But the ads don't mean <i>anything</i> —
I get ads for Ann Coulter ringtones whenever I get email from my
friend who lives in Coulter, Iowa!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o598">The man nodded. "I understand, sir. And
that's just why I'm here talking to you, instead of just looking at
this screen. Why do you suppose model rocket ads show up so
frequently for you?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o599">He thought for a moment. "OK, just do
this. Go to Google and search for 'coffee fanciers', all right?"
He'd been very active in the group, helping them build out the site
for their coffee-of-the-month subscription service. The blend they
were going to launch with was called "Jet Fuel." "Jet Fuel" and
"Launch" — that'd probably make Google barf up model rocket ads.
Not that he would know — he blocked all the ads in his browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o600">They were in the home stretch when the
carved man found the Hallowe'en photos. They were buried three
screens deep in the search results for "Greg Lupinski," and Greg
hadn't noticed them.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o601">"It was a Gulf War themed party," he
said. "In the Castro."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o602">"And you're dressed as —?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o603">"A suicide bomber." Just saying the words
in an airport made him nervous, as though uttering them would cause
the handcuffs to come out.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o604">"Come with me, Mr Lupinski."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o605">The search lasted a long time. They
swabbed him in places he didn't know he had. He asked about a
lawyer. They told him that he could call all the lawyers he wanted
once he was out of the Customs sterile area.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o606">"Good night, Mr Lupinski." This was a new
interrogator, a man who'd wanted to know about the reason that he'd
sought both night diving and deep diving specialist certification
from the PADI instructor in Cabo. The guy implied that Greg had
been training to be an al-Qaeda frogman, and didn't seem to believe
that Greg has just wanted to do all the certifications he could,
pursuing diving the way he pursued everything: thoroughly.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o607">But now the man with the frogman fantasy
was bidding him a good night and releasing him from the secondary
screening area. His suitcases stood alone by the baggage carousel.
When he picked them up, he saw that they had been opened and then
inexpertly closed. Some of his clothes stuck out from around the
edges.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o608">At home, he saw that all the fake
"pre-Colombian" statues had been broken, and that his white cotton
Mexican shirt — folded and fresh from his laundry-lady — had a
boot-print in the middle of it. His clothes no longer smelled of
Mexico. Now they smelled of airports and machine oil.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o609">The mailman had dropped an entire
milk-crate of mail off at his place that day, but he couldn't even
begin to confront it. All he could think of, as the sun rose over
the Mission, turning the Victorian houses they called "painted
ladies" vivid colors, was what it meant to be googled.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o610">He wasn't going to sleep. No <i>way</i>.
He needed to talk about this. And there was only one person who he
could talk to, and luckily, she was usually awake around now.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o611">Maya had started at Google two years
after him, but had gotten a much bigger grant of stock than he had.
She knew exactly what she was going to do with it, too, once she
vested: take her dogs and her girlfriend and head to Florence, for
good. Learn Italian, take in the museums, sit in the cafes. It was
she who'd convinced him to go to Mexico: anywhere, she said,
anywhere that he could reboot his existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o612">Maya had two giant chocolate Labs and a
very, very patient girlfriend who'd put up with anything except
being dragged around Dolores Park at 6AM by 350 pounds of drooling
brown canine.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o613">She went for her Mace as he jogged
towards her, then did a double-take and threw her arms open,
dropping the leashes and stamping on them with one sneaker, a
practiced gesture. "Where's the rest of you? Dude, you look
<i>hawt</i>!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o614">He took the hug, suddenly self-conscious
of the way he smelled after a night of invasive googling. "Maya,"
he said. "Maya, what do you know about the DHS?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o615">She stiffened and the dogs whined. She
looked around, then nodded up at the tennis courts. "Top of the
light standard there, don't look, there. That's one of our muni
WiFi access points. Wide-angle webcam. Face away from it when you
talk. Lip-readers."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o616">He parsed this out slowly. Google's free
municipal WiFi program was a hit in every city where it played, and
in the grand scheme of things, it hadn't cost much to put WiFi
access points up on light standards and other power-ready poles
around town. Especially not when measured against the ability to
serve ads to people based on where they were sitting. He hadn't
paid much attention when they'd made the webcams on all those
access points public — there'd been a day's worth of blogstorm
while people looked out over their childhood streets or patrolled
prostitution strolls, fingering johns, but it had blown over.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o617">Now he felt — <i>watched</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o618">Feeling silly, he kept his lips together
and mumbled, "You're joking."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o619">"Come with me," she said, facing squarely
away from the pole.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o620">The dogs weren't happy about having their
walks cut short, and they let it be known in the kitchen as Maya
fixed coffee for them — barking, banging into the table and rocking
it. Maya's girlfriend Laurie called out from the bedroom and Maya
went back to talk to her, then emerged, looking flustered.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o621">"It started with China," she said. "Once
we moved our servers onto the mainland, they went under Chinese
jurisdiction. They could google everyone going through our
servers." Greg knew what that meant: if you visited a page with
Google ads on it, if you used Google maps, if you used Google mail
— even if you <i>sent</i> mail to a gmail account — Google was
collecting your info, forever.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o622">"They were using us to build profiles of
people. Not arresting them, you understand. But when they had
someone they wanted to arrest, they'd come to us for a profile and
find a reason to bust them. There's hardly anything you can do on
the net that isn't illegal in China."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o623">Greg shook his head. "Why did they put
the servers in China?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o624">"The government said they'd block them if
they didn't. And Yahoo was there." They both made a face. Somewhere
along the way, Google had become obsessed with Yahoo, more worried
about what the competition was doing than how they were performing.
"So we did it. But a lot of us didn't like the idea."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o625">She sipped her coffee and lowered her
voice. One of the dogs whined. "I made it my 20 percent project."
Googlers were supposed to devote 20 percent of their time to
blue-sky projects. "Me and my pod. We call it the googlecleaner. It
goes deep into the database and statistically normalizes you. Your
searches, your gmail histograms, your browsing patterns. All of
it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o626">"The search ads?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o627">"Ah," she grimaced. "Yes, the DHS. So we
brokered a compromise with the DHS. They'd stop asking to go
fishing in our search records and we'd let them see what ads got
displayed for you."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o628">Greg felt sick. "Why? Don't tell me Yahoo
was doing it already —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o629">"No, no. Well, yes. Sure. Yahoo was
already doing it. But that wasn't it. You know, Republicans
<i>hate</i> Google. We are overwhelmingly registered Democrat. So
we're doing what we can to make peace with them before they clobber
us. This isn't PII —" Personally Identifying Information, the toxic
smog of the information age "— it's just <i>metadata</i>. So it's
only slightly evil."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o630">"If it's all so innocuous, why all this
cloak-and-dagger stuff?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o631">She sighed and hugged the dog that was
butting her with his huge, anvil-shaped head. "The spooks are like
public lice. They get everywhere. Once we let them in, everything
suddenly got a lot more — secret. Some of our meetings have to have
spooks present, it's like being in some Soviet ministry, with a
political officer always there, watching everything. And the
security clearance. Now we're divided into these two camps: the
cleared and the suspect. We all know who isn't cleared, but no one
knows why. I'm cleared. Lucky me — being a homo no longer
disqualifies you for access to seekrit crap. No cleared person
wants to even eat lunch with an un-clearable. And every now and
again, one of your teammates will get pulled off your project 'for
security reasons', whatever that means."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o632">Greg felt very tired. "So now I'm feeling
lucky I got out of the airport alive. I suppose I might have ended
up in Gitmo if it had gone badly, huh?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o633">She was staring at him intently, her eyes
flicking from side to side. He waited, but she didn't say
anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o634">"What?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o635">"What I'm about to tell you, you can't
ever repeat it, OK?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o636">"Um, OK? You're not going to tell me
you're a deep-cover Al-Quaeda suicide bomber?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o637">"Nothing so simple. Here's the thing: the
airport DHS scrutiny is a gating function. It lets the spooks
narrow down their search criteria. Once you get pulled aside for
secondary at the border, you become a 'person of interest,' and
they never, ever let up. They'll check the webcams for your face
and gait. Read your mail. Log your searches."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o638">"I thought you said the courts wouldn't
let them —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o639">"The courts won't let them
<i>indiscriminately</i> google you. But once you get into the
system, it becomes a <i>selective</i> search. All legal. And once
they start googling you, they <i>always</i> find something."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o640">"You mean to say they've got a
boiler-room of midwestern housewives reading the email of everyone
who ever got a second look at the border? Sounds like the world's
shittiest job."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o641">"If only. No, this is all untouched by
human hands. All your data is fed into a big hopper that checks for
'suspicious patterns' and gradually builds the case against you,
using deviation from statistical norms to prove that you're guilty
of <i>something</i>. It's just a variation of the way we spot
search-spammers" — the "optimizers" who tried to get their Viagra
scams and Ponzi schemes to come to the top of the search results "—
but instead of lowering your search rank, we increase your
probability of being sent to Syria. And of course, they google all
of <i>us</i>, everyone who works on anything 'sensitive.'"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o642">"Naturally," Greg said. He felt like he
was going to throw up. He felt like never using a search engine
again. "How the hell did this <i>happen</i>? It's such a
<i>good</i> place. 'Don't be evil,' right?" That was the corporate
motto, and for Greg, it had been a huge part of his reason for
taking his fresh-minted computer science PhD from Stanford directly
to Google.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o643">Maya's laugh was bitter and cynical.
"Don't be evil? Come on, Greg. Don't you remember what it was like
when we started censoring the Chinese search results, and we all
asked how that could be anything but evil? The company line was
hilarious: 'We're not doing evil — we're giving them access to a
better search tool! If we showed them search results they couldn't
get to, that would just frustrate them. It would be a <i>bad user
experience</i>. If we hadn't lost our don't-be-evil cherry by then,
we surely did the day we took that one."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o644">"Now what?" Greg pushed a dog away from
him and Maya looked hurt.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o645">"Now you're a person of interest, Greg.
Googlestalked. Now, you live your life with someone watching over
your shoulder, all the time. You know the mission statement, right?
'Organize all human knowledge.' That's <i>everything</i>. Give it
five years, we'll know how many turds were in the bowl before you
flushed. Combine that with automated suspicion of anyone who
matches a statistical picture of a bad guy and you're —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o646">"I'm scroogled."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o647">"Totally."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o648">"Thanks, Maya," he said. "Thanks
anyway."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o649">"Sit down," she said. The dog that had
been bumping at his legs was at it again. Maya took both dogs down
the hall to the bedroom and he heard her muffled argument with her
girlfriend. She came back without the dogs.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o650">"I can fix this," she said in a whisper
so low it was practically a hiss. "I can googleclean you."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o651">"But you're under constant scrutiny
—"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o652">"By DHS agents. Once they fired all
non-native-born Americans from the DHS, it got a lot fatter and
stupider. I can googleclean you, Greg."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o653">"I don't want you to get into
trouble."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o654">She shook her head. "I'm already doomed.
I built the googlecleaner. Every day since then has been borrowed
time — now it's just a matter of waiting for someone to point out
my expertise and history to the DHS and, oh, I don't know. Whatever
it is they do to people like me in the War on Abstract Nouns."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o655">Greg remembered the questioning at the
airport. The search. His shirt, the bootprint in the middle of
it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o656">"Do it," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o657">The ads were weird. He hadn't really paid
attention to them in years. The blocker got rid of most of them,
but Google changed its code often enough that their little text ads
showed up on a lot of his pages. They stayed subliminal mostly —
only clunkers like that Ann Coulter ringtone ad made it past his
eyes into his brain.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o658">Now the clunkers were everywhere:
Intelligent Design Facts, Online Seminary Degree, Terror Free
Tomorrow, Porn Blocker Software, Homosexuality and Satan. He
clicked through a couple of these and found himself in some kind of
alternate universe Internet, full of weird opinions about the evils
of being gay, the certainty of the young Earth, the need for
eternal national vigilance.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o659">Then he started to notice something weird
about the search results themselves. After unpacking his suitcase
and opening his mail, he spent two weeks sitting at home on his
ass, surfing. His pre-Mexico belly was reemerging, so he decided to
do something about it. No burritos for lunch today — he'd go to
that holistic place Maya had told him about. Vegan low-fat cuisine
couldn't possibly be as gross as it sounded.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o660">"Did you mean 'Hungarian
Restaurants'?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o661">He snorted. No, he'd meant "holistic
restaurants," you dumbass search-engine. It nagged at him. He
pulled up his search history and went back through the results,
printing out the pages. Then he logged out of his Google account
and went back through the same searches, comparing the results to
the logged-in pages. The differences were striking. A search for
"democratic primary" pointed to anti-Hillary rants on angry blogs
when he was logged in, and to information on volunteering for the
DNC when he was logged out. Searching for "abortion clinic" while
logged out listed the nearest Planned Parenthood office; searching
while logged in gave him information about Campaign Life,
ProLife.com, and the ProLife alliance. Good thing he wasn't
pregnant.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o662">This was Maya's googlecleaner at work. It
was like the stories of people who asked their TiVos to record an
episode of "Queer Eye" and then got inundated with suggestions for
other "gay shows" — "My TiVo thinks I'm gay," was the title of one
article he remembered. Google had been experimenting with
"personalized" search results before he left the country — here it
was, in all its glory.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o663">Google thought he was a conservative
Christian Republican who supported the War on Terror and many other
abstract nouns.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o664">He logged out of Google — that was
simple. Five minutes later, he logged in again. His entire address
book was in there. He logged out again. Logged back in. His
calendar — when was his parents' anniversary again? Logged out.
Logged back in. Needed his bookmarked locations in Maps. Logged
out.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o665">He stopped trying. Google was where his
friendships lived — all those people he stayed connected to on
Orkut. It was where his relationships lived: all that archived
email, all those addresses in his address-book. It was his family
photos, his bookmarks. Hell, his search history — his real search
history — was like an outboard brain, remembering which parts of
the unplumbable Internet he cared about, so that he didn't have to
remember it the hard way, with the meat in his skull.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o666">Google had a copy of him — all the parts
of him that navigated the world and the people in it. Google owned
that copy, and without it, he couldn't be himself anymore. He'd
just have to stay logged in.</p>

<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o667">Greg mashed the keys on the laptop next
to his bed, bringing the screen to life. He squinted at the toolbar
clock: 4:13AM! Christ, who was pounding on his door at this
hour?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o668">He shouted "Coming!" in a muzzy voice and
pulled on a robe and slippers. He shuffled down the hallway,
turning on lights as he went, squinting. At the door, he squinted
through the peephole, peering at — Maya.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o669">He undid the chains and the deadbolt and
yanked the door open and Maya rushed in past him, followed by the
dogs, followed by her girlfriend, Laurie, whom he'd last seen at a
Christmas party at Google, in a fabulous cocktail dress and an
elaborate up-do. Now she was wearing a freebie Google Summer of
Code sweatshirt, jeans, and a frown that started between her
eyebrows and intensified all the way down her face.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o670">Maya was sheened with sweat, her hair
sticking to her forehead. She scrubbed at her eyes, which were red
and lined.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o671">"Pack a bag," she said, in a hoarse
croak.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o672">"What?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o673">"Whatever you can't live without. A
couple changes of clothes. Anything you're sentimental about —
shoebox of pictures, your grandfather's razor, whatever. But keep
it small, something you can carry. We're traveling light."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o674">"Maya, what are you —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o675">She took him by the shoulders. "Do. It,"
she said. "Don't ask questions right now. There's no time."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o676">"Where do you want to —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o677">"Mexico, probably. Don't know yet.
<i>Pack</i>, dammit." She pushed past him into his bedroom and
started yanking open drawers.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o678">"Maya," he said, sharply, "I'm not going
anywhere until you tell me what's going on."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o679">She glared at him and pushed her hair
away from her face. "The googlecleaner lives. I shut it down,
walked away from it, after I did you. It was too dangerous to use
anymore. But I still get buginizer notifications when new bugs get
filed against it, I'm still in B as the project's owner. Someone
filed eight bugs against it this week. Someone's used it six times
to smear six very specific accounts."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o680">"Who's using it?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o681">"Well, I'll give you a hint. Let me tell
you who's been cleaned this week —" She listed six candidates, four
Republican and two Democrat, who were all in the running for the
primaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o682">"Googlers are blackwashing political
candidates?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o683">"Not Googlers. This is all coming from
offsite. The IP block is registered in DC. And the IPs are all also
used by Gmail users. And those Gmail users —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o684">"You spied on gmail accounts?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o685">"I'm leaving in two minutes, with or
without you. You can interrupt me to ask me questions, or you can
listen." She gave him another look. Laurie stood in the door of the
bedroom, holding the dogs by the collars and looking down at the
floor.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o686">"Good. OK. Yes. I did spy on their email.
Of course I did. Everyone does it, now and again, and for a lot
worse reasons that this.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o687">"It's our lobbying firm. The ones who
invented the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Remember them? It was a
stink when we hired them, but Google couldn't afford to be 'that
company full of registered Democrats' forever. We needed friends in
Congress. These guys could do it for us."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o688">"But they're ruining politicians'
careers!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o689">"Yeah. They certainly are. And who
benefits when they do that?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o690">Laurie spoke, at last. "Other
politicians."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o691">He felt his pulse beating in his temples.
"We should tell someone."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o692">"Yeah," Maya said. "How? They know
everything about us. They can see every search. Every email. Every
time we've been caught on the webcams. Who is in our social network
— you know that if you've got more than fifteen Orkut buddies, it's
statistically certain that you're no more than three steps to
someone who's contributed money to a 'terrorist' cause? Remember
the airport? Imagine a lot more of that."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o693">"Maya," he said, carefully. "I think
you're over-reacting. You don't need to go to Mexico. You can just
quit. We can do a startup together or something. Or you can move to
the country and raise dogs. Whatever. This is crazy —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o694">"They came to see me today," she said.
"At work. Two of the political officers — the minders who monitor
our sensitive projects. And they asked me a lot of very heavy
questions."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o695">"About the googlecleaner?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o696">"About my friends and family. About my
search history. About my political beliefs."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o697">"Jesus."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o698">"They were sending me a message. They
were letting me know that they were onto me. They're watching every
click and every search. It's time to go — time to get out of
range."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o699">"There's a Google office in Mexico, you
know."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o700">"Are you coming, Greg? We're going
now."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o701">"Laurie, what do you think of this?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o702">Laurie thumped the dogs between the
shoulders. "Maya showed me what Google knows about me. It's like
there's a little me in there, a copy of me. Like I'm pinned down
under a jar with a ball of ether. My parents left East Germany in
'65 — they used to tell me about the Stasi. They'd put everything
about you in your file — even unpatriotic jokes. Lately I've been
feeling… watched. All the time. Like I can't live without leaving a
trail. Like I'm throwing off a smog of data and it can't be gotten
rid of."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o703">"We're going now, Greg. Now. Are you
coming?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o704">Greg looked at the dogs. "I've got some
pesos left over," he said. "You take them. Be careful, OK?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o705">She looked like she was going to slug
him. Then she softened and gave him a ferocious hug. "Be careful
yourself," she whispered in his ear.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o706">They came for him a week later. At home,
in the middle of the night, just as he'd imagined it. Their knock
was nothing like Maya's tentative, nervous thump. They went
bang-bang-bang, confident, knowing that they had every right to be
there and not caring who else came after them.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o707">Two men. One stayed by the door and
didn't say anything. The other was a smiler, short and rumpled, in
a sports coat with a small stain on one lapel and a cloisonné
American flag on the other. "Computer Fraud and Abuse Act," he
said, by way of introduction. "'Exceeding authorized access, and by
means of such conduct having obtained information.' Ten years for a
first offense, ever since the PATRIOT Act extended it. I have it on
the best of authority that what you and your friend did to your
Google records qualifies. And oh, what will come out in the trial.
All the stuff you whitewashed out of your profile."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o708">Greg had been playing this scene out in
his head for a week. He'd had all kinds of brave things to say,
planned out in advance. He'd even written some down, to see how
they looked. It had given him something to do while the knots in
his stomach tightened, while he waited to hear from Maya.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o709">"I'd like to call a lawyer," is all he
managed. It came out in a whisper.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o710">"You can do that," the man said. "But
hear me out first."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o711">Greg found his voice. "I'd like to see
your badge."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o712">The man's basset-hound face lit up as he
hissed a laugh. "Oh, Greg, buddy. I'm not a cop. I work for —" He
named the DC firm in Google's employ. The inventors of
swiftboating. "You're a Googler. You're part of the family. We
couldn't send the police after you without talking with you first.
There's an offer I'd like to make."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o713">Greg made coffee. It gave him something
to do with his hands while he tried to find that bravery he'd been
honing all week. "I'll go to the press," he said. "I've written
this all up. I'll go straight to them."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o714">The guy nodded as if thinking it over.
"Well, sure. You could walk into the Chronicle's office in the
morning and spill everything you need. They'd try to find a
confirming source. They won't find it. Maybe you'll try to show
them what your profile looks like today? Well, tell you what, it
looks just like it looked the day you landed at SFO. Greg, buddy,
why don't you hear me out before you start trying to figure out how
to fight me? I'm in the win-win business. I'm in the business of
figuring out how to get all parties what they need. I'm very good
at it. You don't even want to know what I'm billing Google for this
little tete-a-tete. By the way, those are excellent beans, but you
want to give them a little rinse first, takes some of the
bitterness out and brings up the oils. Here, pass me a
colander?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o715">Greg watched in numb bemusement as the
man took off his jacket and hung it over a kitchen chair, then
undid his cuffs and rolled them up, slipping a cheap digital watch
into his pocket. Then he poured the beans back out of the grinder
and into Greg's colander and did things at the sink.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o716">He was a little pudgy, and very pale. He
needed a haircut — had unruly curls at his neck. It made Greg
relax, somehow. This guy had the social gracelessness of a nerd,
felt like a real Googler, obsessed with the minutiae. He knew his
way around a coffee-grinder, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o717">"We're drafting a team for Building 49
—"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o718">"There is no building 49," Greg said,
automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o719">"Yeah," the guy said, with a private
little smile. "There's no Building 49. And we're putting together a
team, with its own buginizer, to own googlecleaner. Maya's code
wasn't very efficient. Every time someone runs it, it clobbers the
whole farm. And it's got plenty of bugs. We've asked around and
there's consensus on this. You'd be the right guy, and it wouldn't
matter what you knew if you were back inside —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o720">"No, I wouldn't," Greg said. "You're on
crack."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o721">"Hear me out. There's money involved.
Good work, too. Smart colleagues. A direction for your life. A
chance to participate in the political life of your country —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o722">Greg gave a bitter laugh. "Unbelievable,"
he said. "If you think I'm going to help you smear political
candidates in exchange for favors, you're even crazier than I
thought."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o723">"Greg," he said, "Greg, you're right.
That was dumb. No one is going to do that anymore. We're just going
to — clean things up a little. For some select people. You know
what I mean, right? Every Google profile is a little scary under
close inspection. Close inspection is the order of the day in
politics. You stand for office and they'll look at your kids, your
brothers, your ex-girlfriends. Now that your search history is
available to so many people, it won't be that hard to look into
that too. Your Orkut network, your old Usenet messages, your
searches, all of it." He loaded the cafetiere and depressed the
plunger, his face screwed up in solemn concentration. He held out
his hand and Greg got down two coffee mugs — Google mugs, of course
— and passed them to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o724">"We're going to do for our friends just
what Maya did for you. Just give them a little cleanup. Preserve
their privacy. That's all — I promise you, that's all."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o725">Greg sipped the coffee, but didn't taste
it. "And whichever candidates you <i>don't</i> clean —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o726">"Yeah," the guy said. "Yeah, you're
right. It'll be tough for them."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o727">"You can go now," Greg said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o728">"Oh, Greg," the guy said. He plucked his
jacket off his chair-back and shrugged it on, felt in the inside
pocket and produced a small stack of paper, folded into quarters.
He smoothed it out and put it on the table.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o729">Greg looked quickly and saw the rows of
results he'd seen on the DHS man's screen, back at the airport,
when this all started. "I don't care," he said. "Tell the world
about my search history. Go ahead. In five years, everyone will
have had their search history ruptured. We'll all be guilty."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o730">"It's not your history," the man said. He
divided the stack into two piles, and pointed to names on the top
sheet of each. One was Maya's. The other was a candidate whose
campaign Greg had contributed to for the last three elections.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o731">"You get five weeks' vacation a year. You
can go to Cabo for the SCUBA. The options package is very generous,
too."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o732">The man sat down and drank some coffee.
Greg tried some more of his own. It didn't taste so bad. It was, in
fact, more delicious than anything that had ever come out of his
kitchen. The man knew what he was doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o733">The best years of Greg's life had been
spent at Google. Smart people. Amazing work environment. Wonderful
technology. Nothing in the world like it. When you worked at G, you
had the best model train set in the universe to play with.
Organizing all of human knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o734">"You can pick your team, of course," the
man said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o735">Greg poured himself another cup of
delicious coffee.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o736">The new Congress took eleven working days
to pass the Securing and Enumerating America's Communications and
Hypertext Act, which authorized the DHS and the NSA to outsource up
to 80 percent of its intelligence and analysis work to private
contractors.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o737">Theoretically, the contracts were open to
a competitive bidding process, but within the secure group at
Google, in building 49, there was no question of who would win
those contracts. If Google had spent $15 billion on a program to
catch bad guys at the border, you can bet that they would have
caught them — governments just aren't equipped to Do Search
Right.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o738">Greg looked himself in the eye that
morning as he shaved — the security minders didn't like
hacker-stubble, and they weren't shy about telling you so — and
realized that today was his first day as a de facto intelligence
agent in the US government.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o739">How bad would it be? Wasn't it better to
have Google doing this stuff than some ham-fisted spook?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o740">He had himself convinced by the time he
parked at the Googleplex, among the hybrid cars and bulging
bike-racks. He stopped for an organic smoothie on the way to his
desk, then sat down and sipped.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o741">The rumpled man hadn't been to the G
since Greg went back to work, but it often felt like his influence
was all around them in building 49. He wasn't any less rumpled
today — he could have been wrapped in saran-wrap on the day he
brought Greg back to work and refrigerated for all that he hadn't
changed a hair.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o742">"Hi, Greg," he said, sliding into the
chair next to his. His podmates stood up in unison and left the
room.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o743">"Just tell me what it is," Greg said.
"Just spit it out. You want me to pwn NORAD and start World War
III, right?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o744">"Nothing so obvious," the man said,
patting his shoulder. "Just a little search-job."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o745">"Yeah?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o746">"There's a person we want to find. A
person who's left the country, apparently headed for Mexico. She
knows certain things that are, as of today, classified. She needs
to be briefed on her new responsibilities."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o747">Greg stood up. "I'm not going to find
Maya for you." He pulled on his jacket.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o748">"There are plenty of people here who
will. It's up to you, though. You can work here with her, being
productive, or you can find out just how rotten life can get —
while she works here, being productive with your co-workers."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o749">Greg stared at him, his hands balled into
fists.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o750">"Come on," the rumpled man said. "Greg,
we both know how this goes. When you said yes to me in your
kitchen, you lost the option of saying no. It's not so bad, is it?
Who would you rather have doing the nation's intelligence: you and
your pals here in the Valley, or a bunch of straight-edge
code-grinders in Virginia?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o751">Greg turned on his heel and left. He made
it all the way to the parking lot before he stopped and kicked a
wall so hard he felt something give way in his foot.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o752">Then he limped back to his desk, hung his
jacket on his chair, and logged back in.</p>

</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o753">It was a week later when his key-card
failed to open the door to Building 49. The idiot red LED shone at
him every time he swiped it. He swiped it and swiped it. Any other
building and there'd be someone to tailgate on, people trickling in
and out all day. But the Googlers in 49 only emerged for meals, and
sometimes not even that.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o754">Swipe, swipe, swipe.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o755">"Greg, can I see you, please?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o756">The rumpled man hadn't shaved in a couple
of days. He put an arm around Greg's shoulders and Greg smelled his
citrusy aftershave. It was the same cologne that his divemaster in
Baja had worn when they went out to the bars in the evening. Greg
couldn't remember his name. Juan-Carlos? Juan-Luis?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o757">The man's arm around his shoulders was
firm, steering him away from the door, out onto the immaculate
lawn, past the kitchen's herb garden. "We're giving you a couple of
days off," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o758">Greg felt a cold premonition that sank
all the way to his balls. "Why?" Had he done something wrong? Was
he going to jail?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o759">"It's Maya." The man turned him around,
met his eyes with his bottomless basset-hound gaze. "It's Maya.
Killed herself. In Guatemala. I'm sorry, Greg."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o760">Greg seemed to hurtle away from himself,
to a place miles above, a Google Earth view of the Googleplex,
looking down on himself and the rumpled man as a pair of dots, two
pixels, tiny and insignificant. He willed himself to tear at his
hair, to drop to his knees and weep.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o761">From a long way away, he heard himself
say, "I don't need any time off. I'm OK."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o762">From a long way away, he heard the
rumpled man insist.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o763">But one-pixel Greg wouldn't be turned
aside. The argument persisted for a long time, and then the two
pixels moved into Building 49 and the door swung shut behind
them.</p>

became evil." I didn't want to cheap out and just write about the

example, <i>all</i> the Microsoft employees I know are fantastic
and smart and caring and principled. But ethically and technically,
most of what comes out of Redmond is a train-wreck. It's
anti-synergy: a firm that is far less than the sum of its parts. I
could easily see Google turning into that. I wish I understood how
groups of good people trying to do good can do bad.</p>
