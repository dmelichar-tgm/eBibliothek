<p class="norm" id="o770"><i>1. Nice networks don't go down</i></p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o771">It was unthinkable that the invisible
ants that governed all human endeavor should catastrophically fail,
but fail they did, catastrophically, on the occasion of Trish's
eighth date with Rainer. It took nineteen seconds for the cascade
of errors to slow every car on the Interstate to a halt, to light
up the dashboard with a grim xmas tree of errors, to still the
stereo and freeze the tickers of information and context that they
had come to think of as the crawling embodiment of the colony that
routed all the traffic that made up their universe.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o772">"We are going to be: So. Late," Rainer
said, and Trish swiveled in her seat to look at him. He was
Fretting again, his forehead wrinkled and his hands clenched on the
steering wheel. When they traded massages (third date) and she'd
rubbed at his hands, she'd found them tensed into claws that
crackled with knuckle-fluid when she bent each finger back and
rubbed sandalwood-scented oil into it. He was mighty cute for a
neurotic — at least he knew it when he was being nuts. Not that
he'd stop being nuts, but he'd cheerfully admit it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o773">"We are not going to be late," she said.
"We just need to manually route ourselves out of the dead spot and
get back on the grid and we'll be on our way. We've got plenty of
time."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o774">"Dead spot?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o775">"Yes," she said. His forehead wrinkles
were looking more klingon by the second. "Dead spot." She forced a
chuckle. "You didn't think that the whole world was down, did
you?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o776">He relaxed his knuckles. "Course not," he
said. "Dead spot. Probably ends up at the turn-off."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o777">"Right," she said. "We need a map. I'm
navigatrix. You're pilot. Tell me where your maps are, then get
onto the shoulder and drive straight."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o778">"Where my maps are? Jesus, what century
do you live in? My maps are with the sextant and sundial, between
my leeches and my obsidian sacrifice-knife."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o779">She laughed. "OK, pal, I'll find a
michelin, you drive. Every car has a couple maps. They
self-assemble from happy meal boxes." She opened the
glove-compartment and started rooting through it while he pulled
onto the shoulder and gunned the tiny two-seater along it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o780">"This is: So. Illegal," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o781">"Naw," she said. "I'm pretty sure you're
allowed on the shoulder when the routing goes down. It's in the
written-test manual. Learned it while I was helping my little
cousin Leelee study. Aha!" she said, holding something up.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o782">"You have a cousin named Leelee? That's
uniquely horrible."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o783">"Shut up," she said. "Look at this." It
was an old-fashioned phone, of a certain handsome retro line that
made it look like a dolphin fucking a silver dildo, the kind of
thing marketed to old people who wanted a device with its
affordances constrained to collapse the universe of all possible
uses for things that fit into your hand into the much smaller
universe of, say, a cellphone.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o784">"Yeah, my mom left that behind a couple
years ago. I looked everywhere for it but couldn't find it. She
must've been snooping in the glove-box. Serves her right. So
what?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o785">"These things can unmesh and talk
straight to a tower at a long distance, can't they?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o786">"I dunno, can they?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o787">"Oh yes, they can. Which means that they
work in dead spots. So we can call and get directions."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o788">"You think you're pretty smart, huh,
dumpling?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o789">She put her finger to her temple and made
an adorable frowny thinky face, and held it until he looked at her
and laughed. They'd discovered their ability to make one another
laugh when he'd farted while taking off his kilt (second date) and
had reflexively swung the hem back to make it appear that his
mighty gust was ruffling the pleats.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o790">"What's your mom's number?" she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o791">He recited it and she tapped it in.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o792">"Hi there! This is Trish, Rainer's
friend? We're on the way, but the, well the, but the — I mean to
say, the grid's down or something. The car doesn't have any nav
system, the dolby's out, the Interstate's a parking-lot… Oh, you
too? God. Wonder if it's the whole country! So, we need directions
from San Luis Obispo, to the cemetery, if possible."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o793">:… :</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o794">"Why yes, it's venti nice to be meeting
<i>you</i>," she said. "I've heard a lot about you, too. Yes, I'm
giving directions, he's driving. Oh, that's so sweet of you. Yes,
he <i>does</i> look like he's going to scrunch his forehead into
his upper lip. I think it's cute, too. Right. Got it. Left, then
right, then left, then a slight left, then up the hill. Got it.
Whups! That's the duracell! Better go. Soon! Yes. Whoops."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o795">"So?" he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o796">"So, your mom sounds nice."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o797">"You got the directions?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o798">"She gave me directions."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o799">"So you know where we're going?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o800">"I don't have a single, solitary clue.
Your mother gives <i>terrible</i> directions, darling. Pull off at
the next exit and we'll buy a map."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o801">"We are going to be: So. Late."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o802">"But now <i>they know</i> we're late. We
have an excuse. You: stop Fretting."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o803">Once they were on the secondary roads,
the creepiness of the highway full of stopped cars and crane-necked
drivers gave way to a wind-washed soughing silence of waves and
beach and palms. Trish rolled down the window and let the breeze
kiss the sweat off her lip, watching the surfers wiping out in the
curl as the car sped toward the boneyard.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o804">"Are you <i>sure</i> this is the kind of
thing you're supposed to bring a date to?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o805">"Yes," he said. "Don't Fret. That's my
job."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o806">"And you don't think it's even a
<i>little</i> weird to take a girl to a cemetery on a date?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o807">"We're not <i>burying</i> anyone," he
said. "It's just an unveiling."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o808">"I still don't get that," she said. "I
keep picturing your mom cutting a ribbon with a giant pair of gold
scissors."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o809">"Right, let's take it from the top," he
said. "And you'd better not be getting me to talk to stop my
Fretting, because appealing to my pedantic nature to distract me is
a <i>very</i> cheap trick."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o810">"I'm fluttering my eyelashes innocently,"
she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o811">He laughed and stole a hand through the
vent in her apron-trousers and over her thigh. "Achtung!" she said.
"Eyes on road, hands on wheel, mind in gutter, <i>this
instant!</i>" She put her hand over his and he put down the pedal.
His hand felt nice there — too nice, for only eight dates and
20-some phone calls and about 100 emails. She patted it again.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o812">"This is kind of fun," he said, as they
zipped past some surfer dudes staring glumly at their long-boards'
displays, their perfect tits buoyant and colored like anodized
aluminum with electric-tinted sun-paste.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o813">"Ahem," Trish said, squeezing his hand
tight enough to make his knuckles grind together. "You were about
to explain tombstone-unveiling to me," she said. "When you got
distracted by the athletic twinkies on the roadside. But I am
sweet-natured and good and forgiving and so I will pretend not to
have seen it and thus save us both the embarrassment of tearing out
your Islets of Langerhans, all right?" She fluttered her eyes
innocently in a way that she happened to know made him melt.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o814">"Explaining! Yes! OK, remember, I'm not
particularly Jewish. I mean, not that my parents are, either:
they're just Orthodox. They don't believe in God or anything, they
just like Biblical Law as a way of negotiating life. I renounced
that when I dropped out of Yeshiva when I was 12, so I am not an
authority on this subject."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o815">"Let the record show that the witness
declared his utter ignorance," she said. "But I don't get this
atheist-Orthodox thing either —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o816">"Just think of them as Mennonites or
something. They find the old ways to be a useful set of rules for
navigating the universe's curves. God is irrelevant to the
belief."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o817">"So they don't believe in God, but they
pray to him?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o818">"Yeah," he said. The surfers were all
coming in now, jiggling their boards and rebooting them and staring
ruefully at the radical cutback off the lip, dude, gnarly, as they
plodded up the beach. "The ritual is the important part. Thinking
good thoughts. Having right mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o819">"It's good advice, most of it. It doesn't
matter where it comes from or how it got there. What matters is
that if you follow the Law, you get to where you're going, in good
time, with little pain. You don't know why or how, but you do."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o820">"It's like following the ants," she said,
watching the stop-and-go traffic in the other direction. "Don't
know why they tell us to go where they do, but they do, and it
works."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o821">"Well, I guess," he said, using the tone
of voice that told her that he was avoiding telling her how wrong
she was. She smiled.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o822">"<i>Anyway</i>. The thing about Jews —
ethnic Jews, cultural Jews, forget the religion here — is that
we're pretty much on the melodramatic end of the grieving scale. We
like to weep and tear at our hair and throw ourselves on top of the
coffins, right? So there's like 5,000 years of this, and during
that time, a bunch of social scientists — Rabbinical scholars —
have developed a highly evolved protocol for ensuring that you
grieve your dead enough that you don't feel haunted by guilt for
having failed to honor them, but not grieving so much that you
become a drag on the tribe.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o823">"When someone dies, you bury him right
away, usually within 24 hours. This means that you spend an entire
day running around like your ass was on fire, calling everyone,
getting the word out, booking last-minute travel, ordering in from
the caterers, picking out a box, fielding consoling phone-calls,
getting the rabbi on the phone, booking the limo, so much crap that
you can't spare even a second to fall to pieces. And then you bury
him, and while you're at it, your family extrudes a volunteer to go
over to your house and take all the cushions off of one of the
sofas, hang sheets over all the mirrors, and set out enough food to
feed the entire state, along with an urn of starbucks the size of
an oil-drum.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o824">"Before the service starts, the rabbi
gives you a razor-blade and you slash a hole in your lapel, so that
you've got the rent in your heart hanging out there in plain sight,
and once you get back home, you spend <i>seven days</i> grieving.
You pray two times a day with a quorum of ten men, facing east and
singing the Kaddish, this really, really depressing
song-prayer-dirge that's specially engineered to worm its way into
the melancholy receptors of the Semitic hindbrain and make you feel
really, really, really miserable. Other people come over and cook
for you, all three meals. You don't see yourself in the mirrors,
you don't sit on cushions, you don't do anything <i>except
mourn</i> for a whole week.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o825">"Then it's over. You take a walk, leaving
by one door and coming back in by the other. You put the mourning
behind you and start your new life without your dear departed.
You've given over your whole life for a whole week, done nothing
but mourn, and you're completely sick of it by then, so you're
almost glad to be done.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o826">"Then, six months or a year later,
usually just before Jewish New Year's, which is in the fall, you
have a tombstone erected at the gravesite. The stone-cutters tie a
white cloth around it, and everyone gathers there, and there's a
sermon, and that dirge again, and more prayer, and everyone has a
good hard cry as the scabs you've accumulated are ripped away and
all your pain comes back fresh and scalding, and you feel it all
again in one hot second, and realize with a guilty start that you
<i>have</i> been neglecting the memory of the loved one, which is
to say that you've gotten on with your life even though his is
over, which is to say that you've done perfectly healthy, normal
stuff, but you feel totally, completely overwhelmed with guilt and
love, which are kind of flipsides of the same emotion —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o827">"You don't believe that, do you?" She
held her breath.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o828">"Well, kind of. Not that they <i>should
be</i>, but hell they <i>are</i>, most of the time, then."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o829">"Good thing we're not in love, then,
right?" she said, in reference to their sixth date, when they'd
decided that they would hold off on any declarations of love for at
least an entire year, since they were most often moved to utter the
Three Words of Significance when they were besotted with e.g.
post-orgasmic brain-juice or a couple of cocktails.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o830">"Yes, counselor."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o831">She shook her head. He <i>knew</i> she
was an academic, not a practicing lawyer, but he loved to tease her
about it, ever since she'd revealed (after third date, on the
phone) that she'd spent about ten seconds in private practice after
she'd worked for her congressman and before she'd joined the
faculty at UCLA.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o832">"You're out of order," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o833">"This whole damned car is out of order!"
he said. "So that's the ritual. You <i>said</i> you wanted to meet
the parents and sisters and aunts and grandmothers and cousins and
uncles and nephews and in-laws the next time we all got together.
This is it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o834">"Right," she said. "I asked for this."
And she had, of course. Hadn't asked for the graveside elements,
but she'd been curious to meet this big sprawling enterprise of a
family that he was always nattering on about. This seemed as good
an occasion as any. "So," she said. "Is this a traditional date
among Your People?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o835">He chuckled. "Yes, this is Yom Shiksa,
the ritual bringing of the gentile woman to the family so that she
may become the subject of intense, relentless scrutiny and
speculation."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o836">She started to laugh, then saw that the
tractors were stilled in the fields they were passing, that a train
was stopped in its tracks, that the surfers were unable to get
their roll-cage dune-buggies to take to the road.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o837">"You all right, babe?" he said, after a
couple minutes of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o838">"Just wondering about the dead spot," she
said. "I wish we knew what had happened."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o839">"Nothing too bad, I'm sure," he said.
"It's all self-healing. I'm sure we'll be back online soon
enough."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o840">They rolled into the parking lot for his
family's <i>shul</i>'s section of the giant graveyard a few minutes
after 1PM, just over an hour late, along with the majority of the
other attendees, all of whom had had to navigate manually.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o841">"Where are your sisters?" Rainer's mother
said, even before he'd kissed her cheek.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o842">Rainer screwed his face up in a scowl and
dug in his pocket for a yarmulke. "Do I know? Stuck in traffic, Ma.
The grid's down everywhere."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o843">Trish watched this bemusedly, in her cool
loose cotton apron-trousers and blouse. She scuffed her toe
conspicuously and Rainer turned to her, and it was as though he'd
forgotten she was there. She felt a second's irritation, then a
wave of sympathy as she saw the spasm of anxiety cross his face. He
was nervous about her meeting his fam, and nervous about who would
arrive when, and nervous about where his sisters were with their
enormous families and meek husbands, trapped somewhere on southern
California's squillion-mile freeway network.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o844">"Ma," he said. "This is my friend,
Trish."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o845">"Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Feinstein,"
Trish said. The old woman was remarkably well-preserved, her soft
skin glowing with heat-flush, her thick hair caught in a tight bun
and covered with a little scarf that reminded Trish of Rainer's
yarmulke. She wondered if she should be wearing one, too. Mrs.
Feinstein's eyes flicked quickly to her shoes, up her legs and
boobs, to her face and hair, and then back to her face. She opened
her arms and drew Trish into a hug that smelled of good, subtle
perfume, though Trish knew so little about scent that she couldn't
have said which. "Call me Reba, darling," she said. "It's so good
of you to come."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o846">And then she was off, hustling to corral
a wayward knot of horseplay-aged cousins, stopping to shake hands
with the deceased great-uncle's poker buddies in their old-man
pants, golf shirts and knit yarmulkes bobby-pinned to their
thinning hair.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o847">Trish took stock. Looked like every other
graveyard she'd been in, which wasn't that many. At 35, she'd been
to half a dozen family funerals, a couple of college buddies who
OD'ed or cracked up their cars, and one favorite poli-sci teacher's
service, so she was hardly an expert on boneyards, but something
was amiss.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o848">"What's with the pebbles on the
headstones?" she whispered to Rainer, who was scanning the road for
signs of his sisters.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o849">"Huh? Oh. You drop those on the monument
when you visit the grave, as a sign that someone's been there."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o850">"Oh," she said, and began to cast about
for a pebble she could put on his great-uncle's headstone once it
was unveiled. There were none to be found. The ground had been
picked completely clean. Looking at the thousands and thousands of
ranged marble headstones, each topped with a cairn of stones — and
not just stones, either, toys and seashells and small sculptures,
she saw now — and she understood why.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o851">"What are you doing?" Rainer asked. He
might have been irritated, or just nervous. It was hard to tell
when he was Fretting, and he was clearly going coo-coo for
coco-puffs.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o852">"Looking for pebbles," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o853">He said :fuck: very quietly. "I meant to
bring some. Damnit. I've got twenty relatives buried here and we're
going to go past every single tombstone before we get to leave and
I don't have a single rock."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o854">"Can you leave toys or other stuff, like
on those stones?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o855">"Yeah," he said. "I suppose. If I had
other stuff."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o856">She opened her purse and pulled out the
dolphin-dildo cellphone. "You still need this?" she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o857">He smiled and his forehead uncreased.
"You're a genius," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o858">She set it down on the pavement and
brought her heel down on it hard, breaking it into dozens of
fragments. "All the pebbles we'll ever need," she said, picking
them up and handing them to Rainer.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o859">He put his arm around her shoulders and
squeezed. "I'm awfully fond of you, Counselor," he said, kissing
her earlobe. His breath tickled her ear and made her think of the
crazy animal new-relationship-energy sex they'd had the night
before — she was still limping, and so was he — and she
shivered.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o860">"You too, steakypaste," she said. "Now,
introduce me to all of your relatives."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o861">"Introduce you?" He groaned. "You don't
think I remember all of their names, do you?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o862">Afterward, they formed a long convoy back
to the nearest family member's house — a great aunt? a second
cousin? Rainer was vague — navigating by keeping everyone in sight,
snaking along the traffic jam that appeared to have engulfed the
entire state, if not the whole coast.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o863">"You made that law, yes? We've all heard
about you." This was the sixth time someone had said this to her
since they'd arrived and Rainer had made her a plate of blintzes,
smoked salmon, fresh bagels, boiled eggs, and baby greens salad
with raspberry dressing, then had been spirited away into an
endless round of cheek-pinching and intense questioning. She'd been
left on her own, and after having a couple of grave conversations
with small children about the merits of different toys, she'd been
latched upon by one of the Relatives and passed from hand to
hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o864">"I was involved in it, but I didn't write
the law," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o865">"Look at you, so modest, you're
blushing!" the Relative said. She reached out to steady a cut-glass
vase as it wobbled in the wake of two small boys playing keep-away
with a third's yarmulke, and Trish realized that this was probably
the hostess.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o866">"This place is just
supercalafragilistic," she said, with an economical gesture at the
tasteful Danish furnishings, the paper books in a handsome oak
bookcase, the pretty garden out one side window and the ocean out
the back window.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o867">"Thank you," the great-aunt said. "My
Benny loved it here." She misted up. Trish finally added two and
two, remembered the BENJAMIN chiseled into the marble headstone,
and the blank spot on the other half of the tombstone, realized
that this wasn't just the hostess, this was the <i>widow</i>, and
felt about for a thing to say.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o868">"It was a beautiful ceremony," she said.
She had a couple napkins tucked in the waistband of her pants, and
without thinking, she extracted one and folded an angle into it,
reaching for the corner of the great-aunt's eye. "Look up," she
said, and blotted the tear before it could draw a line of mascara
down the widow's cheek.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o869">The old woman smiled a well-preserved
smile that reminded Trish of Rainer's mom. "You're a sweet girl,"
she said. "Me, I'm not so good with names, and so I've forgotten
yours."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o870">"I'm Trish," Trish said, bemusedly.
Rainer's grammar got yiddishized when he wasn't paying attention,
and she adored the contrast between its shtetl credibility and his
witty, smooth public banter-persona. It had attuned her to little
phrases like, "Me, I'm not so good."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o871">The widow shook her hand. "I'm Dorothy.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Would you like to come
out to the garden with me?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o872">Once they were seated, young male
Relatives materialized and set up shade-umbrellas and brought out
trays of iced juice.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o873">"They're not after the inheritance, you
know," the old woman said with a snort. "Their parents are
<i>very</i> well-off. They don't need from money. They just adore
me because I've spoiled them rotten since they were babies and I'd
take them swimming and to Disneyland."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o874">"You have a beautiful family," Trish
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o875">"Do you have a big family, too?" The old
woman put on a pair of enormous sunglasses and sipped at her pink
grapefruit juice.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o876">"Not like this one," she said. There were
a couple hundred people in the house, and Rainer had spent the
whole car-ride back from the cemetery Fretting about all the
relations who <i>hadn't</i> made it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o877">"Oh, this one! Well, this is a special
case. This family accumulates other families. My Benny had a small
family, and when he married me, they just joined us. All the high
holidays, we ate here, or at my parents' place, God rest them. Your
family is in DC?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o878">"All over."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o879">"But you're from DC, no?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o880">"Not really. I grew up in Chicago and
Seattle."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o881">"But you made that law —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o882">"I really didn't, honestly! I was
clerking for a Supreme Court judge when the case was heard, and I
wrote his dissenting opinion, and when we lost, I quit and went to
work for a PAC that was agitating for copyright reform to
accommodate free expression, and then when Senator Sandollar got
voted in and they started the Intellectual Property committee and
made her chairman, I joined her staff as a policy wonk. So I worked
on it, along with a couple thousand other people, not counting the
millions who contributed to the campaign and the people who knocked
on doors and so on."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o883">"How old are you, darling?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o884">"35," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o885">"At 35, I was having babies. You — listen
to you. Listen to what you've <i>accomplished</i>! I'm proud just
to <i>listen</i> to you. Rainer is lucky to have you. You two will
get married?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o886">Trish squirmed and felt her face grow
hot. Neither of them really believed in marriage. Whenever anyone
brought the subject up around Rainer, he'd grimace and say, "Are
you kidding? It'd make my mother <i>far</i> too happy — she'd keel
over from joy."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o887">There was some kind of disturbance down
the beach, one that had been growing steadily over the past several
minutes, and now the Relatives were all turning their attention
that way, to a couple of small boys in miniature suits who were
ruining the shine on their shoes running in the sand like
lunatics.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o888">Something in the way they were running,
the distant expressions she couldn't quite make out on their faces.
It made her think back to high-school, to working as a beach
lifeguard on Lake Michigan in the summers, and before she knew what
she was doing, she'd kicked off her shoes and was running for the
shore, her legs flashing immodestly through the vents in her
apron-trousers.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o889">She was still yards away from the hissing
surf when she began to assess the situation. There was the small
boy, bobbing in the ocean, where the undertow had spit him up after
sucking him under. There was the swimmer, unconscious on the beach,
face down. Couldn't tell if his chest was moving, but the small boy
was in a suit, not swim-trunks like the swimmer, and that meant
that he was part of Rainer's Family, which she had begun (on the
eighth date, no less!) to think of as her own, and so she had him
as her primary target before she reached the sea.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o890">She didn't bother finicking with the
buttons on her top, just grabbed her collar and yanked, leaving her
in a bra that revealed less than some bikinis she owned, but did so
through a cunning arrangement of lace, mesh, and structural
engineering that was probably illegal in Texas. She undid the bows
on each hip holding up her pants and stepped out of them, leaving
behind a very small pair of white panties whose primary design
consideration had been to avoid showing lines through thin
trousers, with modest coverage of all her nethers coming in a
distant second.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o891">She plunged into the water without
hesitation, moving swiftly but surely, taking care to keep her feet
dug in against the undertow as she waded out toward the young boy.
She was a strong swimmer, but the water was shockingly cold after
the heat of the garden and the buzzing afternoon and it sucked at
her calves and legs like a jacuzzi intake. Her breath roared in her
ears as she rode the swells, and then she was soaked by a
succession of breakers, and then she had the boy's little hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o892">She hauled him to her, seeing that he was
only five or six, and that his pouting lips were alarmingly blue
and that his skin was as pale as cream. She scooped the water out
of his mouth, hooked her arm around his neck and tilted his head
back and began to slosh back toward shore. When she was waist-deep
— immodestly revealed in a bra that she was quite certain had gone
completely transparent — she pinched his nose and blew into his
mouth, not quite getting her mouth out of the way before he vomited
up a gush of salt-water, blintzes, diet coke, and bile. She spat
and wished that she could duck her head and get a mouthful of ocean
to rinse with, but she couldn't without dunking the boy, too, so
she hauled him up out of the water and handed him to the Relative
who was standing with his arms on the shore, his fine leather shoes
soaked with cold seawater.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o893">She looked for the swimmer, and saw that
he was still face-down in the sand. "You, you and you," she said,
pointing at three young cousins whose wide eyes were flicking from
her boobs to her crotch — white underwear, Christ, why white
underwear today? — to the boy on the sand, who was mobbed now with
Relatives whose hubbub had reached deafening proportions, "Go to
the house, find an old-fashioned phone and call emergency services.
Tell them where we are, and that we have two drowning victims, one
a child, neither breathing. What are you going to do?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o894">The tallest of the three managed to make
eye-contact long enough to say, "Find a cell-phone, call emergency,
tell them where we are, two drownings, not breathing."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o895">"Right," she said. "Come back when you're
done and tell me that it's done."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o896">"You, you," she said, picking out two
tall uncles who looked like they'd worked out or played sports
before they found whatever careers had paid for the nice suits they
were wearing, "Carry him here and lay him down on his side."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o897">She looked for Rainer and found his ass
sticking out of the scrum around the boy. She snagged him by the
belt and dragged him back. "Rainer," she shouted. His forehead was
scrunched, but he was clear-eyed and grim and looked like he was
listening to her, which she found very pleasing. "You need to get
everyone back at least five steps from that kid, and make them
quiet down," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o898">"Right," he said, and took off his jacket
and handed it to her.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o899">"Hold it yourself," she snapped, "I've
got things to do."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o900">"It's to wear," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o901">She surprised herself with a grin.
"Thanks,"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o902">The Relatives were murmuring, or crying,
or bickering, but Rainer <i>hollered</i>. "LISTEN UP," he said.
"All of you get over there by that rock, NOW, or my girlfriend
won't be able to save Jory's life. GO!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o903">And they went, amazingly, crushing back
so quickly they looked like a receding tide. The tall uncles
deposited the swimmer in the sand between them, and she checked his
breathing and saw that it was good.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o904">"Turn him on his side and tell me if he
starts to choke," she said, and turned to the little boy,
struggling to remember her rescue breathing.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o905">She got the boy breathing and ended up
with more puke on her face, on Rainer's jacket, in her hair. His
pulse was thready but there. She turned to the swimmer and saw that
he was a muscular surfer dude in board shorts with a couple of
bitchun tatts and a decent body-paint job. He was breathing, too,
but his heart was erratic as hell. She pressed two fingers to his
throat.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o906">"What happened?" she said. "Who saw it
happen?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o907">One of the aunts stepped forward and
said, "My son says they were playing —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o908">She held up her hand. "Where's your son?"
she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o909">"He's back at the house," the aunt said,
startling back.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o910">"Send someone for him, then tell me what
happened."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o911">The aunt looked like she'd been slapped,
but the other Relatives were staring at her and so she had to talk,
and then the boy arrived and he told it again and it was pretty
much the same story, but she was able to get more details, as she
began to examine both the boy and the surfer's bodies for cuts,
bruises, breaks and punctures. She gave the boy's clothes the same
treatment she'd given her own, gently but forcefully tearing them
off, using a seashell to start the tears at first, then a
pocket-knife that someone put in her hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o912">The story was that the kids had been
playing when they'd seen the surfer floating in the breakers, and
they'd dared each other to fish him out, and the undertow had
sucked them out to sea. One had gotten away, the other had ended
out beyond the waves, and meanwhile, the surfer had beached himself
on his own.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o913">"Right," she said. "Blankets and pillows.
Elevate their feet and wrap them up good." She stood up and
staggered a step or two before Rainer caught her, and the crowd
made a noise that was at once approving and scandalized.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o914">"Get me to the sea," she said. "I need to
soak my head."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o915">So he walked her into the water, he still
in his suit-pants and dress shirt and tie, and held onto her while
she dunked her head and swirled a mouthful of salt water in her
mouth.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o916">"Where are the fucking paramedics?" she
said, as she sloshed back out with him.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o917">"There," he said, and pointed at the
horizon, where a Coast Guard clipper was zooming for the shore.
"The cell-phone was dead, so I fired up a couple flares. You didn't
hear them?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o918">"No," she said. He could have set off a
cannon and she wouldn't have noticed it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o919">She got back to the shore just in time to
see the surfer convulse. She was on him in a second, kneeling at
his side, doing airway-breathing-circulation checks, finding no
pulse, and slamming him onto his back and beginning CPR.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o920">Some time later, she was lifted off him
and two paramedics went to work on him. Someone put a robe over her
shoulders and a cup of juice in her hands. She dropped the juice in
the sand and sticky liquid and beach sand covered her legs, which
she realized now that she hadn't depilated in a week, and that made
her realize that she'd spent a pretty crucial amount of time
prancing around naked in front of her date's family, and that that
was probably not on the timetable until the fifteenth date at
<i>least</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o921">She looked up at Rainer, who was still in
his shoes and as she was in bare feet loomed over her. "God," she
said, "Rainer —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o922">He kissed her. "I love you, Patricia," he
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o923">"Ooh," she said, with a weak smile.
"You're breaking the rules!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o924">"Can you let it go this once?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o925">She made her scrunchy thinky face and
then nodded. "Just don't make a habit of it, you lunk."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o926">It would have been perfect if only the
surfer hadn't died.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o927">They didn't get home until well after
midnight. Parts of LA appeared to be on fire as they inched their
way along the freeway. It was weird to see LA at this speed. They
were used to clipping along at 60 or 70 — over 80 if the traffic
was light — flying over the freeway so fast that the scenery was
just a blur. Only the year before, the <i>New Yorker</i> had run a
40-page paean to LA, a public apology declaring it the most livable
city in America, now that it had licked its traffic problems. It
balanced lots of personal space with thorough urbanization and
urbanity. It was why they both lived there.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o928">Now they seemed to have traveled back 50
years in time, to the bad old traffic-jam-and-smog days. Looters
danced below, torching stores, and the traffic moved so slowly that
some people were apparently abandoning their cars to <i>walk</i>
home — which made the traffic even worse. The smoke from the fires
turned the sunset into a watercolor of reds and mustards and golds,
tones that had blown away with the smog when the last gas-sucking
Detroitmobile was retired for a plastic Nickel-Metal Hydride
jellybean, and all the lanes were repainted to cut them in
half.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o929">It was nightmarish. When they got off the
ramp at Studio City, they found homeless guys directing traffic
with gas-tubes they'd torn out of the bus-shelters. The tubes
glowed in the presence of microwave radio-frequency radiation, and
as each of the trillions of invisible ants in the system attempted
to connect with its neighbors and get the traffic set to rights
again, the RF noise made the tubes glow like sodium lamps.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o930">They coasted into Trish's driveway and
collapsed in her living room.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o931">"You were <i>wonderful</i>, darling,"
Rainer said, peeling off the tracksuit that one of his cousins had
scrounged from the gym-bag in her trunk and donated to Trish. Her
skin was gritted with sand and streaked with stripes of
sunburn.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o932">"God," Trish said, lolling back on the
sofa, just letting him gently brush away the sand and rub lotion
into her skin. "You spoil me," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o933">"You're unspoilable," he said. "Wonderful
girl. You saved their lives," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o934">"What a fucking day," she said. "You
think that my lifeguard training made up for my scandalous
undergarments in your family's minds?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o935">He snorted and she felt his breath tickle
the fine hairs on her tummy. "You're kidding. My mom told me that
if I didn't marry you, she'd have me killed and then fix you up
with someone else from the family — told me it was my duty to see
to it that you didn't get away, just in case someone else fell in
the ocean."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o936">He looked around at the blank walls.
"Creepy not to have any news at all," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o937">"There's a TV in the garage," she said.
"Or maybe the attic. You could find it and plug it in and find out
that no one else knows what's going on, if you feel like it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o938">"Or I could escort you to the bathtub and
we could scrub each other clean and then I could give you a
massage," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o939">"Yes, or you could do that."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o940">"Where did you say the television was?"
he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o941">"You are going to be: In. So. Much.
Trouble." She twined her fingers in his hair and pulled him up to
kiss her.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o942"><i>2. Progress pilgrims</i></p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o943">It took three days for even the thinnest
crawls to return to the walls. In the meantime, people dug out old
one-to-many devices like radios and televisions and set them up on
their lawns so they could keep track of the aftermath of The
Downtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o944">He slept over those three nights, because
no one was going anywhere, anyway, and they had a running argument
over how many dates this counted as, but truth be told, they had a
wonderful time, making omelets for one-another, washing each
other's backs in the shower, stealing moments of sex in the living
room at two in the afternoon without worrying about being
interrupted by a chime, ringer, bell or vibe.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o945">When they weren't enjoying each other,
they took coolers of fizzy drinks onto the lawn and watched the
neighbor's TV set and saw the pundits describing The Downtime. The
news-shows were having a drunken ball with this one: as the only
game in town, they were free to bring a level of craft to their
newsmongering that hadn't been seen since Trish's parents' day,
when news-networks turned catastrophes into light operas, complete
with soundtracks, brand-identities, logo-marks and intermissions
where buffoons worked the audience for laughs.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o946">"Oh, she's your favorite, isn't she?"
Trish asked, goosing Rainer's bicep and taking a sip of his peach
ginger-ade. The pundit had been in heavy rotation since the TV went
back on the air. She was a Norwegian academic mathematician who
wrote books of popular philosophy. She was a collection of
trademark affectations: a jacket with built-up shoulders, a
monocle, a string tie, nipple tassles, and tattooed cross-hatching
on her face that made her look like a woodcut of a Victorian
counting-house clerk. Rainer loathed her — she'd been on the
committee to which he'd defended his Philosophy of Networks thesis,
and she'd busted his balls so hard that they still ached a decade
later when he saw her on the tube.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o947">The pundit explained the
packet-switching, using trains versus automobiles as a metaphor:
"In a circuit uniwerse, every communication gets its own dedicated
line, like a train on a track. Ven I vant to talk to you, ve build
a circuit — a train track — betveen our dewices. No one else can
use those tracks, even if ve're not talking. But packet-svitching
is like a freevay. Ve break the information up into packets and ve
give every packet its own little car, and it finds its own vay to
the other end. If vun car doesn't arrive, ve make a copy of its
information and send it again. The cars have brakes and steering
veels, and so they can all share the same road vithout too much
trouble."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o948">Rainer grit his teeth and hissed at the
set. "She's faking the accent," he said. "She thinks that Americans
believe that anyone with a European accent is smarter than we are.
She can pronounce vee and doubleyou perfectly well when she wants
to — she speaks better English than I do! Besides, <i>she stole
that line from me</i>," he said, "from my <i>thesis</i>," he said,
his face scrunching up again.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o949">"Shh, shh," Trish said, laughing at him.
He wasn't really angry-angry, she knew. Just a little stir crazy.
He was a networking guy — he should have been out there trying to
make the network go again, but he was on sabbatical and no one at
UCLA wanted to hear from him just then.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o950">And then the pundit was off onto ants —
networks modeled on ant-colonies that use virtual pheromones to
explore all possible routes in realtime and emerge a solution to
the problem of getting everything, everywhere, in shortest time.
Rainer kept barking at the TV, and Trish knew he was doing it to
entertain her as much as for any reason, so she laughed more and
egged him on.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o951">The TV cut back to the news-dude, who was
a very cuddly ewok who'd made his name hosting a wheel-of-fortune,
jumping up and down and squeaking excitedly and adorably whenever a
contestant won the grand prize, his fur-plugs quivering. He cupped
his paws to his cheeks and grinned.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o952">"But ants aren't perfect, are they?" the
ewok said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o953">"He's feeding her!" Rainer said. "She's
going to go off on her stupid walking-in-circles bit —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o954">"The thing about using wirtual ants to
map out the vorld and make routing recommendations is that ve can't
really tell the difference betveen a good solution and a bad vun,
without trying it. Sometimes, ants end up valking in circles,
reinforcing their scent, until they starve to death. Ve might find
that our cars tell us that the best vay from San Francisco to San
Jose is via a 1500 mile detour to Las Wegas. It may be true — if
all the traffic eweryvhere else is bad enough, that might be the
fastest vay, but it may just be the ants going in circles."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o955">"God, talk about taking a metaphor too
far," he said. Trish thought that Rainer was perfectly happy to
think about the ants as ants, except when someone raised a point
like this, but she didn't see any reason to raise that point just
then.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o956">The ewok turned to the camera: "One
scientist says we <i>should</i> expect more Downtimes to come. When
we come back from this break, we'll talk to a University of
Waterloo researcher who claims that this is just the first of many
more Downtimes to come."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o957">The screen cut over to a beautiful,
operatic advertisement for some Brazilian brand of coca-cola,
wittily written, brilliantly shot, with an original score by a
woman who'd won three grammies at the Independent Music Awards in
Kamchatka the year before. They watched it with mild attention, and
Trish absently fished another bottle out of the cooler and chewed
the lid off with her side-molars.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o958">She looked at Rainer. He was gripping the
arm-rests of his inflatable chair tightly, dimpling the hard
plastic. She held the bottle to his lips and he took it, then she
rubbed at his shoulders while he took a swallow.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o959">"Let's go back inside and play," she
said. "They won't have anything new to tell us for days."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o960">The crawls were alive the next morning,
exuberantly tracking across the walls and over the mirror and down
the stairs. They picked out the important ones and trailed them to
convenient spots with a fingertip and devoured them, reading
interesting bits aloud to one another.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o961">Soon the crawls had been tamed and only a
few personal messages remained. Trish dragged hers over to the
tabletop, next to her cereal bowl, and opened them up while she
ate. Outside, she could hear the whisper of cars speeding down the
road, and she supposed with a mingling of regret and relief that
she should probably go into her office.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o962">She opened her personal mail. It had been
three days since she'd read it, but for all that, a surprisingly
small amount had accumulated. Of course — everyone else had been
without connectivity, too. This was mostly stuff from the east
coast and Europe, people who'd been awake for a couple hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o963">She read, filed and forwarded, tapping
out the occasional one-word answer to simple questions or bouncing
back messages with a form letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o964">Then she came to the note from the Coast
Guard medic. He didn't mince words. It was in the first sentence:
the surfer dude she'd rescued had had a second cardiac arrest on
the boat. They'd tried what they could, but he hadn't recovered. He
was a freak statistic of The Downtime, another person who'd lost
his life when the ants spazzed out. They'd recovered his board and
found its black-box. The accelerometer and GPS recorded the spill
he'd taken after the loss of climate and wave-condition data from
the other surfers strung out on the coast. He'd stayed up for about
ten seconds before going under.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o965">She stared numbly at the note, the spoon
halfway to her mouth, and then she dropped the spoon into the bowl,
not noticing that it splashed milk down her blouse.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o966">She got up from the table and went into
the kitchen. Rainer was there, in a change of clothes they'd bought
from a mom-n-pop gap at the mall on the corner that had been taking
IOUs from anyone who could show a driver's license with a local
address. She grabbed his wrist, making him slosh starbucks down his
front, she took the cup out of his hand and set it down on the
counter, then put her arms around his chest and hugged him. He
didn't protest or ask any questions, he just put his arms around
her and hugged back.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o967">Eventually, she cried. Then she told him
what she was crying about. She let him tell her that she was a
hero, that she'd saved Jory's life and almost saved the surfer's
life, and she let him tell her that it wasn't her fault for
sloshing into the ocean to rinse off the barf, and she let him tell
her that he loved her, and she cried until she thought she was
cried out, and then she started again.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o968">He took her upstairs and he laid her down
on the bed. He undressed her, and she let him. He put her in fluffy
jammies, and she let him. He wiped away her makeup and her hot
tears with a cool face-cloth, and she let him. He took her hand and
ran his fingers over her fingernails, squeezing each one a little,
the way she liked, and she let him.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o969">"You're going to have a nice lie-down for
a couple hours, and I'm going to be right beside you. I'll call the
department secretary and tell him you're taking a personal day and
will be in tomorrow. Then we're going to go see Jory and his
family, so that you can see the boy whose life you saved, and then
we are going to go for a walk in the hills, and then I'm going to
put you to bed. When you get up in the morning, you can make an
appointment to see a grief counsellor or not. Today, I'm in charge,
all right?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o970">Her heart swelled with love and she felt
a tear slip down her cheek. "Rainer," she said, "you're a
wonder."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o971">"You inspire me, darling," he said, and
kissed her eyelids shut.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o972">Their thirty-fifth date was their
last.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o973">"You're going back to Washington," he
said, when he saw the boxes in her office.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o974">"Yes," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o975">He stood in the doorway of her office.
Trish was painfully aware of the other faculty members in the
corridor watching him. Their romance was no secret, of course.
Everyone in the law department knew about him, all the network
engineers knew about her, and they both took a substantial amount
of ribbing about "mixed marriages" and "interfaith dating."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o976">Trish realized with a pang that it was
likely that everyone in the law department knew that she'd decided
to go back to the Hill but that he'd only suspected it until this
instant.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o977">"Well, good for you," he said, putting on
a brave face that was belied by the Fret wrinkles in his
forehead.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o978">"I'm sorry," she said. "I should have
told you once I decided, but I didn't want to do it over the phone
—"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o979">"I'm glad you didn't," he said, holding
up his hand. "Do you want to come out for dinner with me
anyway?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o980">She gestured at the half-packed office.
"The movers are coming in the morning."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o981">"Well then, do you suppose you could use
some help? I could get some burger king or taco bell."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o982">She looked at him for a long moment,
swallowing the knob in her throat. "That would be lovely. Mexican.
I mean, 'taco bell,'" she said. "Thank you."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o983">He let her pay for it — "You're making
the big bucks now," he said — and he was a surprisingly
conscientious packer, padding her framed pictures carefully and
wrapping her knick-knacks in individual sheets of spun fiber.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o984">"Well then," he said, once he'd finished
writing out a description of his latest box's contents on its
outside, "you always told me that Hill Rats were Hill Rats for
life, I suppose."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o985">"Yeah," she said. She knew she should
explain, but they'd had the argument about it three times since the
new PAC had contacted her and offered her the executive director
position. The explanation wouldn't get any better now that she'd
made up her mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o986">The new PAC, The Association for a
Human-Readable World, was the brainchild of some people she'd
worked with while she was on the Hill. They'd asked her to hire a
team, to scout an office, and then to camp out in the offices of
various important committee chairmen until they passed a law
limiting the scope of emergent networking meshes. The Europeans had
enacted legislation requiring cops, hydroelectric agencies, banks,
hospitals and aviation authorities to use "interrogatable" networks
within ten days of The Downtime. With fifteen thousand dead in
Western Europe alone, with Florence in flames and Amsterdam under
two meters of water, it was an easy call. The US had scoffed at
them and pointed to the economic efficiencies of a self-governing
network, but the people who were funding Human-Readable World
wanted to know where old concepts like "transparency" and
"accountability" and "consent of the governed" fit in when the
world's essential infrastructure was being managed by nonsentient
ant-colony simulations.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o987">"Be gentle with us, OK?" he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o988">"Oh, I wish I had your confidence in my
abilities," she said, sucking on her big-gulp of coke.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o989">He put down his food and looked hard at
her. He stared longer than was polite, even for (ex-) lovers, and
she began to squirm.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o990">"What?" she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o991">"You're not putting me on. Amazing.
Patricia Lourdes McCavity, you have felled an empire and you are
setting yourself up to fell another — and it's one that I'm pretty
heavily invested in, both professionally and financially."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o992">'Come on," she said. "I'm good, but I'm
not superwoman. I was part of a team."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o993">"I've read your briefs. Position papers.
Opinions. Speeches. Hell, your press-releases. They were the most
cogent, convincing explanations for intellectual property reform
I'd ever read. You weren't the judge, but you were his clerk. You
weren't the committee chairman, but you were her head staffer. Taco
Bell underestimated you. Coke underestimated you. Starbucks
underestimated you. Disney underestimated you. Vivendi and Sony
underestimated you. Now you're running your own organization, and
it's pointed at me, and I'm scared shitless, you want to know the
truth. I'm not underestimating you." He'd drawn his dark eyebrows
together while he spoke, and lowered his head, so that he was
looking up at her from under his brow, looking intense as the day
they'd met, when he was delivering a brilliant lecture on
ant-colony optimization to a large lay audience at the law-school,
fielding the Q&amp;A with such convulsive humor and scalding
lucidity that he'd melted her heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o994">She felt herself blushing, then wondered
if she was flushing. She still loved him and still craved the
feeling of his skin on hers, wanted nothing more than another lost
weekend with him, taking turns being the strong one and being the
one who surrendered, soothing each other and spoiling each other.
Thinking of that first meeting brought back all those feelings with
keen intensity that made her breasts ache and her hands flutter on
the box she was eating off of.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o995">"Rainer," she began, then stopped. She
took a couple deep breaths. "I'm not gunning for you, you know. You
and I want the same thing: a world that we can be proud to live in.
Your family's company has contributed more to the public good than
any of us can really appreciate —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o996">He blushed now, too. She never talked
about his father's role in the earliest build-outs of ant-based
emergent routing algorithms, about the family fortune that he'd
amassed through the company that bore his name still, 30 years
after he'd stepped down as Chairman of the Board. Rainer was a
genius in his own right, she knew, and his own contributions to the
field were as important as his father's, but he was haunted by the
idea that his esteem in the field was due more to his surname than
his research. He waved his hands at her and she waved hers
back.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o997">"Shush. I'm trying to explain something
to you. Between your father and you, the world has increased its
capacity and improved its quality of life by an order of magnitude.
You've beaten back Malthus for at least another century. That makes
you heroes.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o998">"But your field has been co-opted by
corrupt interests. When you study the distributions, you can see it
clearly: the rich and the powerful get to their destinations more
quickly; the poor are routed through franchise ghettoes and onto
toll-roads; the more important you are, the fewer number of
connections you have to make when you fly, the better the chance
that you'll get a kidney when you need it. The evidence is there
for anyone to see, if only you look. We need standards for this —
we need to be able to interrogate the system and find out why it
does what it does. That's an achievable goal, and a modest one:
we're just asking for the same checks and balances that we rely on
in the real world."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o999">He looked away and set down his taco.
"Trish, I have a lot of respect for you. Please remember that when
I tell you this. You are talking nonsense. The network is, by
definition, above corruption. You simply can't direct it to give
your cronies a better deal than the rest of the world. The system
is too complex to game. Its behavior can't be <i>predicted</i> —
how could it possibly be <i>guided</i>? Statistics can be
manipulated to 'prove' anything, but everyone who has any clue
about this understands that this is just paranoid raving —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1000">She narrowed her eyes and sucked in a
breath, and he clamped his lips shut, breathed heavily through his
nose, and went on.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1001">"Sorry. It's just wrong, is all. Science
isn't like law. You deal with shades of grey all the time, make
compromises, seek out balance. I'm talking about mathematical
truths here, not human-created political constructs. There's no one
to compromise <i>with</i> — a human-readable emergent network just
doesn't exist. Can't exist. It doesn't make sense to say it. It's
like asking for me to make Pi equal three. Pi <i>means</i>
something, and what it means <i>isn't</i> three. Emergent networks
<i>mean</i> not-human-readable. "</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1002">She looked at him, and he looked at her,
and they looked at each other. She felt a sad smile in the corners
of her lips, and saw one tug at his, and then they both broke out
in grins.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1003">"We're going to be seeing a lot of each
other," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1004">"Oh yes, we are," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1005">"Across a committee room."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1006">"A podium."</p>

<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1007">"On talk-shows."</p>

<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1008">"Opposite sides."</p>

<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1009">"Right."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1010">"No fighting dirty, OK?" he said,
raising his eyebrows and showing her his big brown eyes. She
snorted.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1011">"Give me a hug and go home," she said.
"I'll see you at the hearings when they introduce my bill."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1012">He hugged her, and she smelled him,
thinking, <i>this is the last time I'll smell this smell.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1013">"Rainer," she said, holding him at arm's
length.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1014">"Yes?" he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1015">"I'm going to call you, when I have
questions about ant-colony optimization, all right?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1016">He looked at her.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1017">"I need the best expertise I can get.
It's in your interest to see to it that I'm well-informed."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1018">Slowly, he nodded. "Yes, you're right.
I'd like that. I'll call you when I have questions about policy,
all right?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1019">"You're on," she said, and they hugged
again, fiercely.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1020">Once he was gone, she permitted herself
the briefest of tears. She knew that she was right and that she was
going to make a fool out of him, but she didn't want to think of
that right then. She felt the place behind her ear where he'd
kissed her before going home and looked around her office, five
years of her life in thirty banker's boxes ready to be shipped
across the country tomorrow, according to a route that would be
governed from moment to moment by invisible, notional,
<i>ridiculous</i> insects.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1021">She ate more taco bell. The logo was a
pretty one, really, and now that it had been adopted by every
mom-and-pop burrito joint in the world, they'd really levelled the
playing field. She thought about the old Taco Bell mystery-meat and
plastic cheese and took a bite of the ground beef and sharp
Monterey Jack that had come from her favorite little place on the
corner, and permitted herself to believe, for a second, anyway,
that she'd made that possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">

<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1024">Trish gathered her staff in the board
room and wrote the following in glowing letters on the wall with
her fingertip, leaving the text in her expressive schoolmarm's
handwriting rather than converting it to some sterile font: "First
they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight you. Then
you win."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1025">Her staff, all five of them, chuckled
softly. "Recognize it?" she asked, looking round at them.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1026">"Pee-Wee Herman?" said the grassroots
guy, who was so young it ached to look at him, but who could fire a
cannonload of email into any congressional office on 12 hours'
notice. He never stopped joking.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1027">The lawyer cocked an eyebrow at him and
stroked her moustache, a distinctive gesture that you could see in
any number of courtv archives of famous civil-rights battles,
typically just before she unloaded both barrels at the jury-box and
set one or another of her many precedents. "It's Martin Luther
King, right?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1028">"Close," Trish said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1029">"Geronimo," guessed the paralegal, who
probably wasn't going to work out after all, being something of a
giant flake who spent more time on the phone to her girlfriend than
filing papers and looking up precedents.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1030">"Nope," Trish said, looking at the other
two staffers — the office manager and the media guy — who shrugged
and shook their heads. "It's Gandhi," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1031">They all went, "Ohhhh," except the
grassroots guy, who crossed to the wall and used his fingertip to
add, "And then they assassinate you."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1032">"I'm too tough to die," the lawyer said.
"And you're all too young. So I think we're safe."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1033">"OK," Trish said. "This is an official
pep talk. They're playing dirty now. Last night, my car tried to
take me to Arlington via Detroit. My email is arriving on a 72 hour
time-delay. My phone doesn't ring, or it rings all night long. I've
had to switch it off.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1034">"But what all of this means is that I've
got more uninterrupted work-time than ever and I'm getting
reacquainted with my bicycle."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1035">"Every number I call rings at my
ex-girlfriend's place," the grassroots guy said. "I think we're
going to get back together!"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1036">"That's the right attitude, boy-o," the
lawyer said. "When life gives you SARS, make sarsaparilla. I appear
to be unable to access any of my personal files, and any case-law I
query shows up one sentence at a time. I've discovered that the
Georgetown University law-library makes a very nice latte and
serves a terrific high tea, and I've set Giselle to work on
refiling and cross-indexing twenty years' worth of yellow pads that
had previously sat mouldering in a storage locker that I was paying
far too much for."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1037">"Which has given Giselle a rare
opportunity to explore the rich civil rights history that you
embody," Trish said, looking pointedly at the paralegal. "But I
suspect that she could use a hand, possibly from a grad student or
two who could get some credit for this. Let's ask around at
Georgetown, OK?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1038">The lawyer nodded. The office manager
pointed out that their bill-payments were going astray after they'd
been dispatched to their suppliers but before they were debited
from their — dwindling — account, which meant that they were
getting a couple days' worth of free cash-flow. Only the media guy
was glum, since he couldn't field, make or review calls or
press-releases, which made him pretty useless indeed.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1039">"Right," she said, and scribbled
something on one of the steno pads she'd bought for everyone when
their email started going down three times a day. "This guy owes me
from back in the copyright wars — I fed him some good stories that
he used to launch his career. He was the ABNBC Washington bureau
chief until last year and now he's teaching J-School at Columbia.
Take the afternoon train to Manhattan and bring him back with you

most promising proteges, and tell him that they'll have all the

Sleeping on our sofas. Following us to the toilet. Everything on

</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1040">"It's do-able," the media guy said. "I'm
on it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1041">Once they'd all cleared out, the lawyer
knocked on her door. "You going to be all right?" she asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1042">Trish waved her hands at the piles of
briefing books, red-lined hardcopies, marked-up magazine articles
and memos from her Board of Directors. "Of course!" she said. She
shook her head. "Probably. We never thought we'd get this far,
remember? All this psy-ops shit they're pulling, it's just more
proof that we're on the right track. No one should be able to do
this. It's the opposite of democracy. It's the opposite of civil
discourse."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1043">The lawyer smoothed her moustache.
"Right on," she said. "You should be proud. This is a hell of a
fight, and I'm glad to be part of it. You know we'd follow you into
the sun, right?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1044">Trish fluttered her hands. "God, don't
give me that kind of responsibility."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1045">"All right then, into the ocean. We're
making this happen, is what's important."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1046">"Thanks, babe," Trish said. She put on a
brave smile until the lawyer had backed out of the office, then
stared down at her calendar and looked at her morning schedule.
Three congressional staffers, a committee co-chair, an ACLU
researcher, and the head of the newly formed Emergent Network
Suppliers' Industry Association — a man she had last seen in her
office at UCLA, backing away from a long and melancholy hug.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1047">When he rang off the phone and joined
her, finally, she straightened out her smart cardigan and said,
"Rainer, you're certainly looking… well."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1048">"… funded," he finished, with a small
smile. The Emergent Network Suppliers' Industry Association's new
offices were in a nice Federal Revival building off Dupont Circle,
with lots of stained glass that nicely set off the sculptural and
understated furniture. "It's not as grand as appearances suggest,
Trish. We got it for a song from the receivers in the Church of
Scientology's bankruptcy, furnishings included. It <i>is</i> nice
though. Don't you think?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1049">"It's lovely," she said. Around her,
staffers bustled past in good suits and good shoes and smart
haircuts. "Hard to believe you only set up shop a week ago," she
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1050">"It came furnished, remember," he
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1051">"Oh yes, so you said," she said,
watching a kid who looked like he'd gone tops in his class at the
Naval Academy put his ankles up on the plasticized return beside
his desk and tilt his chair, throwing his head back with wild
laughter at whatever it was some other Hill Rat (in her mind, it
was a key Congressman's aide — some old frat buddy of Mr Navy 2048)
was saying at the phone's other end.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1052">She looked back and Rainer and saw that
he was staring where she had.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1053">"Well, it's a far cry from academic
research," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1054">"I know you'll be very good at it. You
can explain things without making it seem like an explanation. The
first lesson I ever learned on the Hill was, 'If you're explaining
—'"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1055">"'— you're losing,'" he said. "Yeah,
I've heard that. Well, you're the old hand here, I'm just learning
as I go. Trying not to make too many mistakes and to learn from the
ones I do make."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1056">"Do you want some free advice,
Rainer?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1057">He sat down in one of the chairs, which
bulged and sloshed as it conformed itself to his back and butt. He
patted the upholstered jelly beside him. "You may always assume
that I would be immensely grateful for your advice, Trish," he
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1058">She sat down and crossed her legs,
letting her sensible shoe hang loose. "Right. DC is a <i>busy</i>
place. In academic circles, in tech circles, you might get together
to feel out your opponent, or to make someone's acquaintance, or to
see an old friend. You might get together to enjoy the company of
another human being.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1059">"We do that in DC, <i>after</i> working
hours. Strictly evenings and weekends. When you schedule a meeting
during office hours, it has to have a purpose. Even if it appears
to have no purpose, it has a purpose. There's a protocol to
meetings, a secret language, that's known to every Hill Rat and
written nowhere. What time you have the meeting, who's there, who's
invited, who knows it, how long you schedule, whether you cater:
they all say little things about the purpose of the meeting. Even
if you have no reason to call the meeting, one will be read into
it.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1060">"If this was any other city in the
world, it would make perfect sense for you to look me up once you
got to DC. We're still friends, I still think about you from time
to time, but here in DC, you calling me over for a meeting, this
kind of meeting, at this time of day, it means you're looking to
parley. You want to strike a deal before my bill goes to the
committee. I don't know how well you know the Hill, so I don't want
to impute any motives to you. But if you took a meeting like this
with anyone else, that's what they'd assume."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1061">Rainer's forehead crinkled.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1062">"No Fretting," she said. Then she smiled
a sad smile. "Oh, Fret if you want. You're a big boy."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1063">He twiddled his thumbs, caught himself
at it, and folded his hands in his lap. "Huh," he said. "Well. I
<i>did</i> want to talk to you because it's been a while and
because we meant a lot to each other. I <i>also</i> wanted to talk
to you about the bill, because that's what I'm here to do, at a
pretty decent salary. I <i>also</i> wanted to see you because I had
an idea that you'd be different here in your native habitat, and
well, that's true."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1064">She refused to let that make her
self-conscious. Of <i>course</i> she was different, but it wasn't
geographic. The last time they'd seen each other, they were lovers
and friends. Now they were ex-lovers who were being paid to
accomplish opposing, mutually exclusive objectives. She knew that
there was a certain power in not saying anything, so she wrapped
herself in silence and waited for him to say something. She didn't
have to wait long.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1065">"Your bill is going to committee?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1066">"Well, I certainly hope so," she said.
"That's what I'm here for, after all. The discussion draft has been
circulating for a week, and we're confident we'll see it introduced
and assigned to committee by the end of this week. That's what
we're told, anyway. It's got strong bipartisan support. Selling
Congress on the importance of human-generated governance is pretty
easy. Wouldn't want to be in your shoes."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1067">He grinned. "You're trying to psych me
out."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1068">"Maybe," she said, grinning back. "But
that's nothing compared to the psych job that we've been getting
down at my office." She told him about the phone weirdness, the
oddball traffic-management. "Someone on your side has a funny sense
of humor."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1069">His smile faded. "You're still trying to
fake me out," he said. "If you're seeing corruption in the net,
it's because you're looking so hard, you can't help but find it.
You're reading malice into accident. Dead spots aren't personal,
you know. This is a law of nature — the networks emerge solutions,
they're the best they can come up with. If you don't like the
results, talk to nature, not me."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1070">She shrugged. "Whatever, Rainer. I know
what's happening. You'll believe what you want to believe." She
pursed her lips and made an effort at controlling her irritation.
"It's really happening, and it's not helping your side. If you know
who's responsible, you might let him know that the dirty tricks are
what convinced Senator Beauchamp's staff to green-light the bill.
Conspiracy is supposed to be beneath the surface. It doesn't look
so good when it's exposed to fresh air and sunshine."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1071">"You've got to be kidding," he said.
"Doesn't matter, I suppose. All right, message received. If I
happen to run into someone whom I think should hear it, I'll be
sure to pass it on, OK?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1072">"That's all I ask," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1073">"You want to talk about the bill
now?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1074">"Have you seen the discussion
draft?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1075">He squirmed. "No," he admitted. "I
didn't know it existed until just now."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1076">"I'd offer to send you a copy, but I
expect it would take a week to arrive, if it ever did. Why don't
you ask that guy," she gestured at the Navy man, "to get you a
copy? He looks like he knows his way around. And then drop by my
office if you want to chat about it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1077">She stood up and tugged at her cardigan
again. "It's been very nice seeing you," she said. She picked up
her coat and her mitts. "Good luck settling in."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1078">He gave her a hug — which felt weird,
hugging was strictly west-of-the-Mississippi, and she broke it off
firmly — and showed her to the door. The first snows were coming
in, and the steps were slightly icy, so she maneuvered them slowly,
carefully. When she reached the road, he was no longer in the
doorway. He was standing right behind her, breath coming out in
foggy huffs.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1079">"Trish," he said, then stopped. His arms
dropped to his sides and his shoulders slumped.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1080">"Rainer," she said, keeping her voice
calm and neutral.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1081">"God," he said. "God. How'd this happen,
Trish? Look, I've never been happy the way I was with you. I
haven't been that happy since. God, Trish —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1082">"Rainer," she said again, taking one of
his hands, firmly, motherly. "Rainer. Stop it. You're here to do a
job, and your job requires that you and I keep it on a professional
level. It doesn't matter how it happened —" But it did, didn't it?
She'd left him to come east and do something he thought of as
wrong-headed and backwards and superstitious. But she'd left him,
not the other way around. And he'd never recovered, though she'd
built herself a new life here. It wasn't a contest (but she was
winning anyway). "It doesn't matter. We respect each other. That's
enough."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1083">He deflated and she said, "Oh, come
here," and gave him a long and soulful hug, right there on the
street, knowing that she was giving the hug and he was taking it.
Then she let him go, spun him round, and gave him a little push
back toward his office.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1084">By the time she reached the corner and
looked back over her shoulder, he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1085">That afternoon, her phone started
ringing normally, with actual people on the other end. Her outbound
calls were connected. Her email was delivered. Her car got her home
in record time. She sighed as she eased it into her driveway and
carried her briefcase inside and poured herself a very small glass
of Irish whisky so rare that it had been known to make grown men
weep. Normally, she saved it for celebrations, but if she was
celebrating something, she was damned if she knew what it was.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1086">Her phone rang as she was licking the
last few drops of liquor from the little glass. It was the lawyer,
with news.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1087">"I just stopped by the office and found
a messenger on the doorstep. He had hard-copy of a press-release
from Senator Beauchamp's office. They're introducing the bill in
the morning. Congrats, kid, you did it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1088">Trish set the glass down and said
:whoopee: very quietly and very emphatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1089">"You're durned tootin'," the lawyer
said. "And double for me."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1090">Of course, it wasn't over by a long
shot. Getting a bill introduced was not the same as getting it
through committee. Getting it through committee was not the same as
getting it passed in the Senate, and getting it passed in the
Senate was not the same as getting it passed in the House, and then
who the hell knew what the hereditary Chimp-in-Chief in the Oval
Office would do when it was passed through the bars of his cage
with his morning banana.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1091">But she had ridden back into town less
than a year before, and she had gone from nothing to this. The ACLU
was supporting the bill, and EFF, EPIC, all the old civ-lib mafia
had opened their arms to her. She poured herself one more very
small whisky, gave herself a fragrant bath and put herself to bed,
grinning like a fool.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1092">"There are four news-crews, six print
reporters, and a couple of others here to see you," the
office-manager said. The office phones were out again, but that
hadn't stopped a fair number of determined people from figuring out
that they could actually move their physical being from one part of
Washington to another and have a real, old-fashioned face-to-face.
The lawyer and she had each taken a dozen press "calls" that
morning, with their embedded reporters from Columbia J-School
perched obtrusively in the corners of their offices, taking copious
notes and filming constantly.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1093">"Others?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1094">"A mixed bag. Some Hill people, some I'm
not sure about."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1095">Trish stood and stretched out her back,
listening to it pop. She usually worked in bursts, typing or
talking for an hour, then taking a little walk to gather her
thoughts and touch base with her co-workers. Today, she'd been
glued to her seat from 7AM to after lunchtime, and her back and
butt were shrieking at her.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1096">She walked into the front area, trailed
by her reporter. She recognized some of the journos and some of the
Congressional staffers, and a local rep from a European Privacy
think-tank in Brussels, and — Rainer.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1097">He was turned out in a very natty suit
and a homburg, a fashion that had recently come back to DC, and she
knew that he'd been put together by a personal shopper. Her own
Board had suggested to her, matter-of-factly, that she should get
one of her own once the bill cleared committee, since she'd be
doing tons of press and as sharp a dresser as she fancied herself,
she was no pro. Her prodigious talents, they assured her, lay
elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1098">He took her hand with both of his and
gave her a long, intense hand-shake that drew stares from the
journos and the think-tank man.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1099">"Nice to see you again, Ms. McCavity,"
he said, somberly.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1100">"A pleasure as always, Mr. Feinstein,"
she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1101">"I'm sorry to drop in on you
unannounced," he said, "but I hoped that I could have just a moment
of your time." Belatedly, he remembered to take off his silly hat
and then he fumbled with the right way to hold it, settling for
dropping it to his waist and upending it. She thought he looked
like a panhandler in a Charlie Chaplin movie and she suppressed a
smile. His curly hair had been gelled into a careful configuration
that reminded her of the glossy ringlets of a black poodle.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1102">"I suppose we can do that," she said.
She turned to her other visitors. "Who's got a 3PM deadline?" she
said. Two of the print-reporters held up their hands. "You then
you," she said. "Who's got a 5PM filing deadline? 6PM? 10PM?" She
triaged them all, promised to meet the think-tank man for dinner at
an Ethiopian place in Adams-Morgan, and led Rainer into her office
and closed the door.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1103">He looked at her embedded reporter and
cocked his head.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1104">"Sorry, Rainer," she said. "I have a
shadow for the duration. Just pretend he isn't here. You don't
mind, do you dear?" she said to the reporter, who was very young
and very bright and missed nothing. He shook his head and made some
notes.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1105">"The bill's dead," Rainer said, after
he'd sat down.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1106">"Oh really?" she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1107">"Just heard from Senator Rittenhouse,
personally. He takes the position that this should be in Commerce,
not Judiciary, and is calling hearings to make that happen."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1108">Rittenhouse was another powerful
committee chairman, and this wasn't good news. What's more, he was
in the pocket of the network operators and had been for a decade,
so much so that editorialists and talk-radio types called him "The
Senator from The Internet."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1109">Still, it wasn't catastrophic. "That's
interesting," she said, "but it's a far cry from killing the bill.
It's pretty standard, in fact. Just slows things down." She smiled
at him. He was just a kid sometimes, so out of his depth here. He
reminded her of the Relatives she'd met that day, the little boys
in their miniature suits running on the beach.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1110">He shifted in his seat and fondled his
hat-brim. "Well, I guess we'll see. My press-liaison has set up a
post-mortem debate on one of the news-networks tonight, and I
thought you might want to represent the other side?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1111">She smiled again. He was twice the
rhetorician that she was, but he had no idea how to play the game.
She'd have to be careful to bruise, not break him.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1112">"We, as a society, make trade-offs all
the time," Rainer said. He was wearing a different suit this
evening, something that Trish had to admit looked damned good on
the studio monitors (better than her frumpy blouse and wool
winter-weight trousers). "We trade a little bit of privacy for a
little bit of security when we show identification before going
into a federal building —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1113">The ewok held up his paw. "But how much
should we be willing to trade, Ms. McCavity?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1114">She looked into the camera, keeping her
eyes still, the way she'd been told to if she didn't want to appear
tourettic. "Wickett, when Franklin said, 'Those willing to give up
a little liberty for a little security deserve neither security nor
liberty,' he wasn't spouting empty rhetoric, he was laying the
groundwork for this enduring democratic experiment that we all
love. Look, we're not opposed to the use of autonomous networks for
<i>some</i> applications, even <i>most</i> applications, with
appropriate safeguards and checks and balances. No nation on earth
has the reliance that we do on these networks. Are they an
appropriate way of advising you on the best way to get to the mall
on a busy Saturday? Absolutely, provided that everyone gets the
best advice the system can give, regardless of economic status or
influence. But should they be used to figure out whom the FBI
should open an investigation into? Absolutely not. We use judges
and grand juries and evidence to establish the sufficiency of a
request to investigate a private citizen who is considered innocent
until proven guilty. We learned that lesson the hard way, during
the War on Terrorism and the Ashcroft witch-hunts. Should we trade
grand juries and judges for ant-colonies? Do you want the warrant
for your wiretap issued by an accountable human being or by a
simulated ant-hill?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1115">The ewok turned to the camera. "Both
sides make a compelling case. What do you think? When we come back,
we'll take your calls and questions." The lights dimmed and it
adjusted its collar and cracked its hairy knuckles on the table
before it. Ever since it had made the move to a pbs, it had been
grooming its fur ever-more conservatively and trying out a series
of waistcoats and short pants. It turned to her and stared at her
with its saucer-sized black button eyes. "You know, I just wanted
to say thanks — I had self-identified as an ewok since I was five
years old, but Lucasfilm just wouldn't license the surgery, so I
went through every day feeling like a stranger in my body. It
wasn't until your law got enacted that I was able to find a doctor
who'd do it without permission."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1116">She shook its paw. "It wasn't my law,
but I helped. I'm glad it helped you out." She unconsciously wiped
her palm on her thigh as the ewok turned to his make-up boy and let
him comb out its cheeks. She stared at Rainer, who wasn't looking
good. She'd had him on the ropes since their opening remarks, and
the ewok kept interrupting him to let her rebut — and now she knew
why.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1117">Rainer had his phone clamped to his
head, and he was nodding vigorously and drumming his fingers. He
was sweating, and it was making his hair come un-coiffed. Trish's
own phone buzzed and she looked down at in surprise. It was her
voice-mail, coming back to life again. It had started when she got
to the studio — when she got within a few yards of Rainer, she
realized. Messages coming in. She'd transcribed a dozen in the
green-room before they'd dragged her into makeup.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1118">The studio lights blinked and Rainer
popped the phone back into his pocket and the ewok turned to look
back into the camera, examining the ticker scrolling past his
prompter. He introduced them again, then turned to Trish.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1119">"Ms. McCavity, Alberto in San Juan
writes in wanting to know what changes we should institute in the
networks."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1120">She said, "It's not my place to say what
technical changes the networks need to have. That's where experts
like Mr. Feinstein come in. We'd ask the administrative branch to
solicit comments from people like him to figure out exactly what
technical changes could be made to allow us to remain competitive
without giving up our fundamental liberties in order to beat the
occasional traffic jam."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1121">"Mr. Feinstein?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1122">He grinned and leaned forward. "It's
interesting that Ms. McCavity should disavow any technical
expertise, since that's what we've been saying all along. If she's
getting stuck in traffic, it's because there's a <i>lot</i> of
traffic. The ant-nets route <i>five thousand percent more
traffic</i> than our nation's highways ever accommodated without
them, and they've increased the
miles-per-hour-per-capita-per-linear-mile by <i>six thousand, four
hundred percent</i>. You're stuck in traffic? Fine. I get stuck
sometimes too. But for every hour you spend stuck today, you're
saving <i>hundreds</i> of hours relative to the time your parents
spent in transit.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1123">"The other side of this debate are
asking for something impossible: they want us to modify the
structure of the network, which is a technical construct, built out
of bits and equations, to accommodate a philosophical objective.
They assert that this is possible, but it's like listening to
someone assert that our democracy would be better served if we had
less gravity, or if two plus two equaled five. Whether or not
that's true, it's not reasonable to ask for it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1124">The ewok turned to her.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1125">She said, "Well, we've heard a great
deal about the impossibility of building democratic fundamentals
into the network, but nothing about the possibilities. This hard,
no-compromise line is belied by the fact that we know that the rich
and powerful manipulate the network to their own advantage,
something that statistics have proven out —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1126">"See, this is <i>exactly</i> how these
Human-Readable types do it, it's how their media-training goes.
They are here to ask for changes to <i>technical</i>
specifications, but they disavow any technical knowledge, and when
they're called on this, they spout dubious 'statistics' that
'prove' that up is down, black is white, and that millionaires can
get to the movies in half the time that paupers can. The Emergent
Network Suppliers' Industry Association represents the foremost
experts in this field, but you don't need to be an expert to know
that these networks <i>work</i>. The ants take us where we want to
go, in the shortest time, with the highest reliability. Anyone who
doubts that can dig out her map and compass and sextant and try to
navigate the world without their assistance, the way they do in
Europe."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1127">Her mouth was open. <i>Media
training</i>? Where did he get this business about <i>media
training</i>? "I'm not sure where Mr. Feinstein gets his
information about my media training from, but personally, I'd
rather talk about networks." She paused. "Let's talk about Europe,
where they <i>have</i> found ways of creating transparency and
accountability for these 'unregulatable' algorithms, where the sky
<i>hasn't</i> fallen and the final trump hasn't sounded. What do
they know that we don't?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1128">"What indeed?" the ewok said, breaking
in and giving her the last word again. "More of your questions
after this break."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1129">They got in their cars together after
they'd scrubbed off their makeup and shaken paws with the ewok,
riding down in the elevator shoulder to shoulder, slumped and
sweaty and exhausted. They didn't speak, and the silence might have
been mistaken for companionable by someone who didn't know any
better.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1130">They got off at the same floor in the
parking garage and turned in the same direction, and Trish spied
his car, parked next to hers, the last two on the floor. Quickening
her step, she opened her door and turned the car on, backing up so
that she was right behind Rainer.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1131">He backed out slowly, looking at her
quizzically in his rearview, but she refused to meet his eye, and
when he pulled out, she rode his bumper.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1132">"Sweet fancy Moses," she breathed, as
the traffic parted before them, allowing them to scythe through the
streets, onto the beltway. She hung grimly onto his bumper, cutting
off cars that tried to shift into her lane. Moving this fast after
so much time stuck on the roads — it felt like flying. She laughed
and then got a devilish idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1133">Spotting a gap in the passing lane, she
zipped ahead of Rainer and swerved back into his lane so that she
was in the lead. As though a door had slammed shut, the traffic
congealed before them into a clot as thick as an aneurysm. She
hissed out a note of satisfaction, then waited patiently while
Rainer laboriously passed her again, and the traffic melted away
once more.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1134">It was tempting not to get off at her
exit, but she had to get some sleep, and so she reluctantly changed
lanes. There wasn't much traffic on the road, but every traffic
light glowed vindictive red all the way to her house.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1135">The Chairman of her Board messengered
over a hand-written note of congratulations that was on her
doorstep. Beneath it was a note from Rainer's great-aunt, with the
best wishes of his mother in neat pen beneath it. She read its kind
words as she boiled the kettle, and put it into her pile of
correspondence to answer. Rainer's great-aunt wanted to know if she
had met a nice boy in DC yet, but she didn't come right out and say
it — too subtle for that. The women in Rainer's family got all the
subtlety, and they recognized their own kind. It was why she and
the old lady kept writing to each other; that and so that the
Relatives could reassure themselves that someone in full possession
of lifeguardly skills and a level head was watching out for
Rainer's interests.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1136">This business of hand-written,
hand-delivered notes and letters was actually kind of charming, she
thought as she put her feet up on her coffee table and opened up
her flask of very special Irish whisky again.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1137">She and Rainer went head to head in half
a dozen more skirmishes that month — her phone popping back to life
every time she got within shouting distance of him. The
on-again/off-again hearings in both Judiciary and Commerce never
quite materialized.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1138">She was better at playing the game, but
he was a fast learner, and he had much deeper pockets and working
network infrastructure. Her Board approved her renting out an empty
suite of offices below their office and converting them to bedrooms
for her staff for days when their cars couldn't get them home. They
secretly borrowed elderly network appliances from relatives or
bought them in the dollar-a-pound bin at the Salvation Army, but
always, within a few hours of being in the possession of someone in
the employ of the Association for a Human-Readable World, the
devices would seize up and lose their routes to the network. Their
offices started to fill up with dead soldiers, abandoned network
boxes that no one could get online.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1139">The embedded journalists went home after
the second week. Their own gear was seizing up, too, as though the
curse of the Association for a Human-Readable World was rubbing off
on them. They vowed to return when things got interesting again,
but they were of no use to anyone without working cameras, mics,
and notepads.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1140">Christmas came and went, and New Year's,
and then February arrived and the city turned to ice and slush and
perpetual twilight. The paralegal quit — she needed a job where the
phones worked so that she could call her girlfriend. The media guy
took a series of "personal days" and she wasn't sure if he'd show
up again, but it didn't matter, because the press had stopped
calling them.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1141">Then came the second Downtime.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1142">It struck during morning rush-hour on
Valentine's Day, a Monday, and it juddered the whole country to a
halt for eight long days. The hospitals overflowed and doctors used
motorized scooters to go from one place to another, unable to
spread their expertise around with telemedicine. Firemen perished
in blazes. Cops arrived too late at crime-scenes. Grocery stores
didn't get their resupplies, and schools dug out old chalk-boards
and taught the few students who lived close enough to walk. Fed
cops of all description went berserk, and could be seen walking
briskly from one federal building to another, their faces grim.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1143">And suddenly, miraculously, every
journalist, policy-wonk, staffer, advisor, clerk and cop in DC
wanted to have a chat with the Association for a Human-Readable
World.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1144">She hired three more people that week,
and borrowed four more from fellow-traveler organizations. Paying
their salaries for the next four weeks would bottom out the group's
finances, but she knew that this was now or never, and the Board
backed her, after some nail-biting debate.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1145">Rainer showed up on the fourth day of
the Downtime, and she found him standing, bewildered, in the hustle
of her office as her staffers penned notes on steno pads to their
contacts on the Hill and handed them to waiting bicycle couriers in
space-program warmgear that swathed them from fingertips to
eyeballs. She plucked him out of the bustle and brought him back to
her office.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1146">"I've got a hell of a nerve," he said,
sitting in her guest-chair.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1147">"Really?" she said. "I hadn't
noticed."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1148">"Well, I haven't been showing it off.
But I'm about to. I need advice. My office is falling apart. You've
been living with no communications and no travel for a year now,
you know how to make it work. We're completely lost. I've come to
throw myself on your mercy." He looked up at her with his big brown
eyes, and then they crumpled shut as he made his Fretting face.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1149">"You're playing me, Rainer," she said.
"And it won't work. Whatever I feel for you, I've got a job to do,
and if this Downtime tells us anything, it's that I'm doing the
right thing, and you're doing the wrong thing."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1150">He hung his head. He wasn't even the
slightest bit natty that day. She supposed that his personal
assistant was stuck in Fall's Church or Baltimore or somewhere,
unable to get into the city. Judging from the slush and road-salt
on his shoes, he must have walked the two miles between their
offices.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1151">"What's more, I don't have any advice to
give you, in particular. We're not faring well here because we're
doing something differently — we're faring well because we're doing
what we've been at all along, because of a network outage that you
claim is impossible, is a figment of our imagination. Those bike
messengers: we've been their best customers for months now.
Everyone else is begging for service from them, but they're always
here when we need them. We've got beds and changes of clothes and
toilet-kits in the offices downstairs. We've been living through a
Downtime for a couple of quarters now — we've hardly noticed the
change. If you want to cope as well as we are, well, you can go
back in time, rent out spare offices to house your staff, establish
a good working relationship with a bike-messenger company, learn to
navigate the Metro and the freeways by map, and all the other
things we've done here."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1152">He looked defeated. He began to stand,
to turn, to leave.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1153">"Rainer," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1154">He paused.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1155">"Close the door and sit down," she
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1156">He did, looking at her with so much hope
that it made her eyes water.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1157">"Here's my offer," she said. "You and I
will lock ourselves in this office with the last draft of my bill.
My staff will run interference for me with the Judiciary committee,
and we will draft a version of my bill that we can both live with.
We will jointly take it to Senators Beauchamp and Rittenhouse, with
our blessings, and ask them to expedite it through <i>both</i>
committees. Every Congresscritter on the Hill is sitting around
with his thumb up his ass until the lights come back on. We can get
this voted in by Tuesday."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1158">He stared down at his hands. "I can't do
it," he said. "My <i>job</i> is <i>not to compromise</i>. I just
can't do it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1159">"Come on, Rainer, think outside the box
for a minute here." Her heart was pounding. This could really be
it. This could be the solution she'd been waiting for. "Even if the
bill passes, there's going to be a long deliberation over the
contours of the regulation, probably at the FCC. You'll be able to
work on the bureau staffers and at the expert agencies, take
ex-parte meetings and lobby on behalf of your employers. It's all
we've ever asked for: an expert discussion where the public
interest gets a hearing alongside of private enterprise and
government."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1160">But he was shaking his head, standing up
to go. "You're probably right, Trish," he said. "I don't know. What
I know is, I can't do what you're asking of me. They'd just fire
me."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1161">"If the Downtime continues, they won't
be <i>able</i> to fire you — they won't even know what you're up to
until it's too late. And then they'll make the best that they can
out of it. No one is better qualified to represent your side in the
administrative agencies."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1162">He put his ridiculous hat on and wrapped
his scarf around his neck, and they looked each other in the eyes
for a long moment. She waited for the involuntary smile that
looking into his eyes inevitably evoked, but it didn't come.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1163">"I don't understand you, Trish. You won
this incredible victory for cooperation, for collective ownership
of our intellectual infrastructure. Ant-networks demand the same
cooperation from the nodes, that my phone pass your car's messages
to his desk. Let's just set aside the professional politics for a
second. Just you and me. Tell me: how can you <i>not</i> support
this?" He looked at her out from under his brows, staring
intensely. He swallowed and said, "It was the surfer, wasn't
it?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1164">"What?" she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1165">"The one who died. That's why you're
doing this. You want to make up for him —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1166">She couldn't believe he'd said it. Taken
such a cheap shot. "I'm surprised you didn't save that one for
television, Rainer. Jesus. No, I'm doing this because it's
<i>right</i>. In case you haven't noticed, your self-healing,
uncorruptible network is <i>down</i>. People are suffering. The
economy is tanking. The death toll is mounting. You won't even bend
one <i>inch</i>, one <i>tenth of an inch</i>, because you're
worried about losing your job."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1167">"Trish," he said, "I'm sorry, I didn't
mean —"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1168">Her office door opened and there stood
her embedded journalist. "I just got in from Manhattan," he said.
"Can I set up in that corner there again?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1169">"Be my guest," she said, grateful for
the distraction. Rainer looked at her, forehead scrunched, and then
he left.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1170">"It's a good thing you're not over him,"
the lawyer said, pouring her another victory whisky. The bill had
passed the House with only one opposing and two abstentions, and
had squeaked through the Senate by five seats, at five minutes to
midnight on the eighth day of the Downtime. They were halfway to
the bar (where the office manager had been feeding twenties to the
bartender to stay open) when the grid came back up, crawls
springing to life on every surface and cars suddenly zipping
forward in the characteristic high-speed ballet of efficiently
routed traffic. They'd laughed themselves stupid all the way to the
bar and after a brief but intense negotiation between the lawyer
and the barman, he'd produced a bottle of Irish that was nearly
half as good as the stuff Trish kept at home.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1171">"I'm going to pretend you didn't say
that," Trish said, sipping tenderly at the booze.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1172">"Come on, girl," the lawyer said,
twirling her moustache. "Be serious. You two had so much sexual
energy in that room, it's a wonder you didn't make the bulbs
explode. It's how you got inside each other's heads. You weren't
selling the committee, you were selling <i>him</i>, and that's what
made you so effective. We're going to need that again at the FCC,
too — so no getting over him until after then."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1173">Trish drank her whisky. She didn't know
what to say to that. He'd looked ten years older tonight, in the
corridors, whispering to his committee members, to his staffers,
his face drooping and wilted. She supposed she didn't look any
better. It had been, what, three days? since she'd had more than an
hour's sleep.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1174">"I don't get it," she said. "How could
he be so dumb? I mean, it's obvious that the system is being gamed.
Obvious that we're being targeted through it. Yet he sits there,
insisting that white is black, that up is down, that the network is
autonomous and immune to all corruption."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1175">"It's like a religion for them," the
lawyer said. "It doesn't need explaining. It's just right-living.
It's the Law."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1176">Trish thought back to the ceremony in
the graveyard, the dirge and the prayers to a god no one believed
in. Had Rainer really renounced his faith when he dropped out of
Yeshiva?</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1177">"Here's to a human-readable world,"
Trish said, raising her glass. Around her, the staffers and
borrowed staffers and hangers-on and even the barman raised their
glasses and cheered. It was warm and the feeling swelled in her
tummy and up her chest and through her face and she burst out in
what felt like the biggest smile of her life.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o">#</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1178">She'd learned a long time ago never to
send email while drunk, but it had been too much last night.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1179">"What if, Rainer, what if — what if the
reason for the Downtimes is that someone is manipulating the
network and that's breaking it. Did you ever wonder about that?
Maybe the network <i>is</i> as good as you say it is — until
someone screws it up by trying to get preferential treatment for
his pals.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1180">"Wouldn't that be a kick in the teeth?
We get five squillion percent increases in across-the-board routing
efficiency, but in the end, it's never enough for people who can't
be happy unless they're happier than someone else.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1181">"The thing that saves the human race,
but if we adopt it, it will destroy us. Irony sucks."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1182">She'd signed it "Love," but even drunk,
she'd had the sense to take that out before sending it. Saying
"Love" would have been no more appropriate than saying, "You know,
I <i>did</i> save your cousin's life." She'd called in no favors,
she'd run no blackmail, and she'd won anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1183">He rang her doorbell at 5AM. She was
barely able to drag herself out of bed.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1184">"I figured you'd be getting up to deal
with the press soon," he said, and she groaned. He was right. She'd
earned some time off, but it'd be a month before she could take it.
Too much press to do. She appreciated anew how much work it must
have taken to be any of her old bosses from the copyright wars: the
judge, the senator, the executive director of the PAC.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1185">She was in her robe, and he was in jeans
and a UCLA sweatshirt. He didn't have any gel in his hair, which
was matted down by the knit cap he'd been wearing. He looked
adorable.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1186">"They fired me this morning," he
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1187">"Oh, hon —" she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1188">"I would have quit," he said. "I'm
outmatched."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1189">She felt herself blush. Or was she
flushing? She was suddenly aware of his smell, the boy smell, the
smell that she could smell in his chest, in his scalp, in his
tummy, lower… She straightened up and led him into the living room
and started the coffee-maker going.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1190">"When do you fly back, then?" she
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1191">He looked at her, smiling. "I don't
know," he said. "I haven't booked a ticket."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1192">She felt an answering smile at the
corners of her mouth and turned into the fridge to fetch out some
gourmet MREs. "Bacon and eggs or pancakes?" she said, then laughed.
"I guess bacon is out," she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1193">"Oh, I'm willing to bet that that bacon
hasn't been anywhere near a pig," he said, "but I'll have the
pancakes, if you don't mind."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1194">She set everything to perking and went
into the bedroom to pull on something smart and camera-friendly,
but everything was in the hamper, so she settled for jeans and a
decent shirt from last-year's wardrobe.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1195">When she opened the door, he was
standing right there, taller than her. "I think you're right," he
said. "About the network. It's the best explanation I've heard so
far."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1196">She wrapped herself in silence again,
waited for him to say more.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1197">"You see, the <i>true</i>, neutral
network is immune to corrupting influences and favoritism. So the
existence of corruption and favoritism means that what we've got
<i>isn't</i> a true network. Which means you're right! We need to
have a hearing to get to the bottom of this, so that we can build
the true network." He smiled bravely. "I thought maybe you could
use an expert in your corner who'd say that in a hearing?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1198">"Thanks," she said, and slipped under
his arm and back into the kitchen. Suddenly, she wanted very much
to be back at her office, back with her staff, talking to reporters
and overseeing a million details. "I'll think about it."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1199">"I'm giving up my apartment at the end
of the month — next Monday. I won't be able to afford it without
the Association's salary," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1200">Her place was big. A bedroom, a home
office, a living room and a dining room. It was a serious deal for
DC, even outside the beltway. It could easily accommodate a second
person, even if they weren't sleeping together.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1201">Her office — her staff — the press — the
bill — her Board.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1202">"Well," she said, "I've got to get
going. I'll shower at the office. Got to get there in time to catch
the Euro press-calls. Let me put your breakfast in a bag, OK?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1203">He looked whipsawed. "Uh, OK. Can I give
you a ride?"</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1204">"No, I'll need my car this afternoon.
Thanks, though." She kept her voice light, didn't meet his eyes.
Kept thinking: her office — her staff — the bill.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1205">"Well," he said. He turned for the door.
Stopped. She tensed. He turned back to her. "Trish," he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1206">"It's OK," she said. "It's OK. We just
have religious differences, is all."</p>
</div>
<div class="substance">
<p class="norm" id="o1207">She slipped past him and into her car,
and left him standing in her driveway. As she asked the car to plot
a route for her back to the Hill, she dug through her purse for a
pocket-knife. At the next red light, she took her lapel and slashed
at it, opening a rent in her shirt that reflected a little of what
her heart was feeling. It made her feel a little better to do
it.</p>

<p class="norm" id="o1210">I wrote this story for Alice, who was
then my girlfriend and is now my wife. Alice is smart as anything
and I wanted to show off to her.</p>

<p class="norm" id="o1211">So I stole two ideas: Eric Bonabeau's
ground-breaking work on "ant-colony optimisation" (the basis of his
consulting firm Icosystem, built on work he did at the Santa Fe
Institute) and Natalie Jeremijenko's provocative notion of "legible
computing" — that is, computing whose results can be interpreted by
laypeople. Eric's handing the keys to the kingdom to emergent
systems that are spookily good but can't be interrogated. Natalie
wants a Protestant Reformation for computing in which we can all
understand what's being discovered by our computer systems. These
two ideas are both fantastic, but they can't peacefully coexist, or
can they?</p>
