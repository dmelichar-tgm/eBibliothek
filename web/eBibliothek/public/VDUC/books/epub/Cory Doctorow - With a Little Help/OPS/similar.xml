Ware Tetralogy</em></a>
<p>Your Guide to the 21st Century!</p>
<p>It starts with Software, where rebel robots bring immortality to
their human creator by eating his brain. Software won the first
Philip K. Dick Award.</p>
<p>In Wetware, the robots decide to start building people —and
people get strung out on an insane new drug called merge. This
cyberpunk classic garnered a second Philip K. Dick award.</p>
<p>By Freeware, the robots have evolved into soft plastic slugs
called moldies —and some human “cheeseballs” want to have sex with
them. The action redoubles when aliens begin arriving in the form
of cosmic rays.</p>
<p>And with Realware, the humans and robots reach a higher

Great Gatsby</em></a>
<p>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write
"something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple +
intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately
patterned, and above all, simple novel became The Great Gatsby,
arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which
he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its
decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's
generation and earned itself a permanent place in American
mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies
some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions:
money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby
believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year
recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no
matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms
farther.... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and
eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about
the American Dream.</p>
<p>It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's
quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years
before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville
beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but
while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying,
but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes
himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to
the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice
is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's
more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion
across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address,
throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does,
events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama,
with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus
throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline
prose, The Great Gatsby is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind
of poem.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>"Now we have an American masterpiece in its final form: the
original crystal has shaped itself into the true diamond. This is
the novel as Fitzgerald wished it to be, and so it is what we have
dreamed of, sleeping and waking." -- James Dickey</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The Great Gatsby is a novel by the American author F. Scott
Fitzgerald. First published on April 10, 1925, it is set on Long
Island's North Shore and in New York City during the summer of
1922.</p>
<p>The novel takes place following the First World War. American
society enjoyed prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the
economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale
and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment,
made millionaires out of bootleggers. After its republishing in
1945 and 1953, it quickly found a wide readership and is today
widely regarded as a paragon of the Great American Novel, and a
literary classic. The Great Gatsby has become a standard text in
high school and university courses on American literature in
countries around the world, and is ranked second in the Modern
Library's lists of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century.</p>

The Win</em></a>
<p>In the virtual future, you must organize to survive</p>
<p>At any hour of the day or night, millions of people around the
globe are engrossed in multiplayer online games, questing and
battling to win virtual “gold,” jewels, and precious artifacts.
Meanwhile, others seek to exploit this vast shadow economy, running
electronic sweatshops in the world’s poorest countries, where
countless “gold farmers,” bound to their work by abusive contracts
and physical threats, harvest virtual treasure for their employers
to sell to First World gamers who are willing to spend real money
to skip straight to higher-level gameplay.</p>
<p>Mala is a brilliant 15-year-old from rural India whose
leadership skills in virtual combat have earned her the title of
“General Robotwalla.” In Shenzen, heart of China’s industrial boom,
Matthew is defying his former bosses to build his own successful
gold-farming team. Leonard, who calls himself Wei-Dong, lives in
Southern California, but spends his nights fighting virtual battles
alongside his buddies in Asia, a world away. All of these young
people, and more, will become entangled with the mysterious young
woman called Big Sister Nor, who will use her experience, her
knowledge of history, and her connections with real-world
organizers to build them into a movement that can challenge the
status quo.</p>
<p>The ruthless forces arrayed against them are willing to use any
means to protect their power—including blackmail, extortion,
infiltration, violence, and even murder. To survive, Big Sister’s
people must out-think the system. This will lead them to devise a
plan to crash the economy of every virtual world at once—a Ponzi
scheme combined with a brilliant hack that ends up being the
biggest, funnest game of all.</p>
<p>Imbued with the same lively, subversive spirit and thrilling
storytelling that made LITTLE BROTHER an international sensation,
FOR THE WIN is a prophetic and inspiring call-to-arms for a new
generation.</p>

whisked away to a secret prison where they’re mercilessly
interrogated for days.</p>

<p>Perry and Lester invent things—seashell robots that make toast,
Boogie Woogie Elmo dolls that drive cars. They also invent entirely
new economic systems, like the “New Work,” a New Deal for the
technological era. Barefoot bankers cross the nation,
microinvesting in high-tech communal mini-startups like Perry and
Lester’s. Together, they transform the country, and Andrea Fleeks,
a journo-turned-blogger, is there to document it.</p>
<p>Then it slides into collapse. The New Work bust puts the
dot.combomb to shame. Perry and Lester build a network of
interactive rides in abandoned Wal-Marts across the land. As their
rides, which commemorate the New Work’s glory days, gain in
popularity, a rogue Disney executive grows jealous, and convinces
the police that Perry and Lester’s 3D printers are being used to
run off AK-47s.</p>
<p>Hordes of goths descend on the shantytown built by the New
Workers, joining the cult. Lawsuits multiply as venture capitalists
take on a new investment strategy: backing litigation against
companies like Disney. Lester and Perry’s friendship falls to
pieces when Lester gets the ‘fatkins’ treatment, turning him into a
sybaritic gigolo.</p>
<p>Then things get really interesting.</p>

<p>Jules is a young man barely a century old. He's lived long
enough to see the cure for death and the end of scarcity, to learn
ten languages and compose three symphonies...and to realize his
boyhood dream of taking up residence in Disney World.Disney World!
The greatest artistic achievement of the long-ago twentieth
century. Now in the keeping of a network of "ad-hocs" who keep the
classic attractions running as they always have, enhanced with only
the smallest high-tech touches.Now, though, the "ad hocs" are under
attack. A new group has taken over the Hall of the Presidents, and
is replacing its venerable audioanimatronics with new, immersive
direct-to-brain interfaces that give guests the illusion of being
Washington, Lincoln, and all the others. For Jules, this is an
attack on the artistic purity of Disney World itself. Worse: it
appears this new group has had Jules killed. This upsets him. (It's
only his fourth death and revival, after all.) Now it's war....</p>

<p>Alan is a middle-aged entrepeneur in contemporary Toronto, who
has devoted himself to fixing up a house in a bohemian
neighborhood. This naturally brings him in contact with the house
full of students and layabouts next door, including a young woman
who, in a moment of stress, reveals to him that she has
wings--wings, moreover, which grow back after each attempt to cut
them off.</p>
<p>Alan understands. He himself has a secret or two. His father is
a mountain; his mother is a washing machine; and among his brothers
are a set of Russian nesting dolls.</p>
<p>Now two of the three nesting dolls, Edward and Frederick, are on
his doorstep--well on their way to starvation, because their
innermost member, George, has vanished. It appears that yet another
brother, Davey, who Alan and his other siblings killed years ago,
may have returned...bent on revenge.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances it seems only reasonable for Alan to
involve himself with a visionary scheme to blanket Toronto with
free wireless Internet connectivity, a conspiracy spearheaded by a
brilliant technopunk who builds miracles of hardware from parts
scavenged from the city’s dumpsters. But Alan’s past won’t leave
him alone--and Davey is only one of the powers gunning for him and
all his friends.</p>
